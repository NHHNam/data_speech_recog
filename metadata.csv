A_Different_Way-1|People without a lot of outdoor space sometimes grow a garden in containers such as raised beds. 
A_Different_Way-2|They refill the containers each year with several bags of nutrient-rich soil and compost that they purchase. 
A_Different_Way-3|But there is another way to provide soil for small gardens. 
A_Different_Way-4|The method is called. 
A_Different_Way-5|Kugel culture. 
A_Different_Way-6|The idea is that nature should be left. 
A_Different_Way-7|To do its own thing. 
A_Different_Way-8|With as little human interference as possible. 
A_Different_Way-9|Google creature means hill culture in german. 
A_Different_Way-10|The process involves letting large pieces of trees and plants decompose and turn into nutrient-rich soil. 
A_Different_Way-11|Just as they would on a forest floor. 
A_Different_Way-12|The resulting soil is arguably better than anything you can buy at a garden store. 
A_Different_Way-13|Hoogle culture can be used in raised beds or in mounds directly on the ground. 
A_Different_Way-14|Here is how it works. 
A_Different_Way-15|Instead of filling deep raised beds with purchased soil and compost. 
A_Different_Way-16|Fill them with yard waste. 
A_Different_Way-17|This reduces the amount of soil needed. 
A_Different_Way-18|And increases nutrients and plant growth. 
A_Different_Way-19|Start by building up about 40% of the depth of your container with a layer of old logs. 
A_Different_Way-20|The logs should come from hardwood trees like maple. 
A_Different_Way-21|Poplar or birch. 
A_Different_Way-22|Softwoods from evergreens are also acceptable. 
A_Different_Way-23|But they decompose more quickly. 
A_Different_Way-24|Do not use wood from redwood trees or black locust. 
A_Different_Way-25|Because they are decay resistant. 
A_Different_Way-26|Wood from trees like the black walnut. 
A_Different_Way-27|Release matter that prevents growth and should be avoided to. 
A_Different_Way-28|Cover the logs with smaller pieces of wood like fallen branches twigs and sticks. 
A_Different_Way-29|These make up the next 10% of death. 
A_Different_Way-30|Next add a layer of leaves and other soft plant remains + pieces of fruit vegetables and egg shells that are left over from your own food. 
A_Different_Way-31|Make sure these fresh foods fill spaces in the woody layer under them. 
A_Different_Way-32|Then water the layer well. 
A_Different_Way-33|Finally add a layer of compost. 
A_Different_Way-34|And a layer of topsoil in equal amounts. 
A_Different_Way-35|Water each layer as you add it. 
A_Different_Way-36|If you are making a free-standing mound. 
A_Different_Way-37|Decide how big you would like it to be. 
A_Different_Way-38|Dig a trench in the ground that is about 30 cm deep. 
A_Different_Way-39|Fill the trench with logs and cover it with a layer of twigs sticks and branches. 
A_Different_Way-40|Cover the woody layers with upside down sections of the removed ground. 
A_Different_Way-41|Cover that with kitchen leftovers compost and topsoil. 
A_Different_Way-42|Aim for a mound that is wider at its face then it stopped. 
A_Different_Way-43|As the organic matter in hulu couch or beds breaks down. 
A_Different_Way-44|Height of the mound will sink. 
A_Different_Way-45|Simply add compost as needed. 
A_Different_Way-46|The breakdown will warm the soil and create airflow. 
A_Different_Way-47|It also will greatly reduce the need for irrigation. 
A_Different_Way-48|And provide plants with a long-term supply of nutrients. 
A_Different_Way-49|Soil in hoogle culture beds or mounds. 
A_Different_Way-50|Can increased harvests and create larger plants for up to 20 years. 
A_Different_Way-51|I'm ashley thompson.

Academy_Weighs_Actions-8|It is a 7.6 m tall. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-9|Model of a shark. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-10|The strange part is in the sculptures positioning. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-11|Up on top of the hanson haina house. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-12|It appears from the street. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-13|As if the huge fish dove straight through the home's roof. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-14|Magnus hansen hyenas father bill put up the sculpture in 1986. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-15|As a protest against war and nuclear weapons. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-16|He worked on the art project with his friend. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-17|Sculptor john buckley. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-18|Bill hiner was an american who studied law at the university of oxford and made the town his home. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-19|He got the idea for the sculpture after he heard. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-20|American warplanes. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-21|Fly over his house. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-22|One night in april 1986. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-23|The next morning. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-24|He learned that the plans had been on their way to bomb tripoli libya. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-25|The men put the sculpture on display on august 9th. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-26|To mark the 41st anniversary. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-27|Have the atomic bomb attack. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-28|Hiroshima japan. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-29|The image. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-30|Of a shark crashing through the home. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-31|Captured the shock. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-32|Civilians must feel when bombs smash into their homes. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-33|Magnus hansen hina said. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-34|Bill hiner died in 2019. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-35|Magnus hansen hina calls the local governments declaration. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-36|About the sculpture absurd. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-37|His father he explained never sought. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-38|Nor accepted permission to put up the shark. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-39|In fact. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-40|He strongly believed his son said. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-41|Set the government should not decide what are the public should see. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-42|And hanson hyena noted. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-43|The same local council. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-44|It has declared the shark historic and protected. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-45|Had spent years seeking its removal. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-46|The sharks anti-war message. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-47|Is just as important today hansen hina said. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-48|As russian bombs fall on ukraine. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-49|That's obviously something that the people in ukraine are experiencing right now. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-50|In very real time he said. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-51|Well that message is serious this strange sculpture that rises over the otherwise normal street. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-52|Insights some fun and laughter as well. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-53|Especially when someone asks about the model sharks unseen head. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-54|The story is that it crashed through to just above the toilet. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-55|That. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-56|A laughing magnus hansen hina said. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-57|Is a myth. 
Academy_Weighs_Actions-58|I'm dan friedel. 
Advanced_Classes-1|Since the beginning of 2021 at least 17 states have passed measures. 
Advanced_Classes-2|Andaz how public schools. 
Advanced_Classes-3|Can teach highly debated subjects. 
Advanced_Classes-4|Says the publication education week. 
Advanced_Classes-5|These efforts however have caused concern among some teachers. 
Advanced_Classes-6|Of advanced placement or ap classes. 
Advanced_Classes-7|These are college-level classes taught to high school students. 
Advanced_Classes-8|Ap classes in us history for example. 
Advanced_Classes-9|Require discussion of subjects like slavery. 
Advanced_Classes-10|And european colonization. 
Advanced_Classes-11|Legislative measures aimed at limiting disputed ideas in schools. 
Advanced_Classes-12|Have been mainly led by republican party lawmakers. 
Advanced_Classes-13|Some of the measures are aimed at preventing the teaching of critical race theory. 
Advanced_Classes-14|Orsi's rt. 
Advanced_Classes-15|Crt is a way of understanding american society. 
Advanced_Classes-16|That places great importance on how race shaped its politics. 
Advanced_Classes-17|And culture. 
Advanced_Classes-18|It is taught in universities. 
Advanced_Classes-19|Some officials say there is little evidence that crt is being taught a lot in american public schools. 
Advanced_Classes-20|Education week says several other states have similar bills. 
Advanced_Classes-21|Currently under consideration. 
Advanced_Classes-22|It has been following efforts to pass these kinds of education measures. 
Advanced_Classes-23|Around the country. 
Advanced_Classes-24|The measures are different depending on where they are being introduced. 
Advanced_Classes-25|In ohio for example. 
Advanced_Classes-26|A bill that was introduced last may. 
Advanced_Classes-27|Would ban school districts from teaching advocating or promoting divisive concepts. 
Advanced_Classes-28|Divisive concepts are ideas that caused a lot of disagreements between people. 
Advanced_Classes-29|A new hampshire bill would ban teaching a negative account or representation of the founding and history of the united states of america. 
Advanced_Classes-30|But some teachers doubt it is possible to teach some subjects without raising questions that caused people to disagree. 
Advanced_Classes-31|Chassis honor is an ap american history teacher. 
Advanced_Classes-32|In montgomery county maryland. 
Advanced_Classes-33|She told voa last year. 
Advanced_Classes-34|Said it would be very hard to teach her class without teaching america's history of racism. 
Advanced_Classes-35|In order to teach an ap us history class correctly. 
Advanced_Classes-36|You have to talk about those things she said. 
Advanced_Classes-37|You can't prepare students. 
Advanced_Classes-38|If you're not teaching the truth about u.s. history. 
Advanced_Classes-39|Ap is a nationwide program. 
Advanced_Classes-40|That provides high school students with college-level classes. 
Advanced_Classes-41|Through the ap program. 
Advanced_Classes-42|Students can in many cases. 
Advanced_Classes-43|Earn credits towards a college degree. 
Advanced_Classes-44|Classes offered include history english math and art. 
Advanced_Classes-45|The college board is the nonprofit organization based in new york city. 
Advanced_Classes-46|That creates the curriculum for high school ap classes. 
Advanced_Classes-47|Ap classes are unlike other classes in american high schools. 
Advanced_Classes-48|The curriculum of most classes. 
Advanced_Classes-49|Is set by local school districts. 
Advanced_Classes-50|The college board's told education week in january. 
Advanced_Classes-51|That it does not know of any examples. 
Advanced_Classes-52|In which state requirements conflict with the standards of college-level ap courses. 
Advanced_Classes-53|But in march the group sent teachers a reminder of aps most important ideas and values. 
Advanced_Classes-54|Called principles. 
Advanced_Classes-55|The principles suggest the organization could bar schools. 
Advanced_Classes-56|From offering ap classes in districts where teachers are limited. 
Advanced_Classes-57|In what they can teach. 
Advanced_Classes-58|Students are expected to analyze different perspectives. 
Advanced_Classes-59|From the road. 
Advanced_Classes-60|The principal state. 
Advanced_Classes-61|The ap statement of principles also says. 
Advanced_Classes-62|If a school bans required topics from their ap courses. 
Advanced_Classes-63|The ap program removes the ap designation from that course. 
Advanced_Classes-64|And its inclusion in the ap course ledger. 
Advanced_Classes-65|Provided two colleges. 
Advanced_Classes-66|And universities. 
Advanced_Classes-67|Most of the legislative measures are aimed at kindergarten through 12th grade schools. 
Advanced_Classes-68|But the new york-based nonprofit organization pen america. 
Advanced_Classes-69|Says it found 40 bills that target what can be taught at colleges. 
Advanced_Classes-70|And universities. 
Advanced_Classes-71|Some political officials. 
Advanced_Classes-72|Have said they oppose the teaching of disputed ideas in colleges. 
Advanced_Classes-73|Texas lieutenant governor dan patrick said on twitter in february. 
Advanced_Classes-74|I will not stand by and let looney marxist university of texas professors. 
Advanced_Classes-75|Poison the minds of young students with critical race theory. 
Advanced_Classes-76|He added we bandit in publicly-funded k through 12. 
Advanced_Classes-77|And we will bennett's in publicly-funded higher-ed. 
Advanced_Classes-78|Some college professors oppose many of the bills. 
Advanced_Classes-79|In a statement last year the american association of university professors. 
Advanced_Classes-80|Said that when politicians. 
Advanced_Classes-81|Mandates the academic content that faculty can and cannot teach. 
Advanced_Classes-82|They prevent colleges and universities. 
Advanced_Classes-83|From fulfilling their missions. 
Advanced_Classes-84|Frank scott is an ap us history teacher in texas. 
Advanced_Classes-85|He said discussing topics like racism and violence in the us. 
Advanced_Classes-86|Do not make students dislike the country. 
Advanced_Classes-87|He told education week. 
Advanced_Classes-88|That when you're honest with the things that are not very pleasant. 
Advanced_Classes-89|You have students that come around to loving this country even more. 
Advanced_Classes-90|Because of what it's been through. 
Advanced_Classes-91|I'm janovic.

Afghan_Woman_with_Top_Test_Score_Worries-21|the Taliban asked women to stay home

Africa_Still_Fa-38|and Kanga song called on the leaders of wealthy Nations meeting this week at the Group of Seven to share available vaccine supplies
Africa_Still_Fa-39|I'd like to believe that the G7 countries

Africa_Still_Fa-53|often repeated by leaders of wealthy Nations
Africa_Still_Fa-54|is meaningless unless they share their excess vaccine
Africa_Still_Fa-55|they say that while they're hoarding the vaccine
Africa_Still_Fa-56|Ibrahim said
Africa_Still_Fa-57|can you walk the talk
Africa_Still_Fa-58|stop just talking like parrots do you really mean what you said

Africa_a_Possible_Center-4|Comes at a time when africa's renewable energy business is already increasing. 
Africa_a_Possible_Center-5|Many african nations are increasing efforts to use more renewable energy. 
Africa_a_Possible_Center-6|Such as solar and wind energy. 
Africa_a_Possible_Center-7|They are moving away from dependence on fossil fuels.

After_Helping_Fight-18|Van herk noted that the ways military forces were used in the pandemic. 
After_Helping_Fight-19|Morphed overtime. 
After_Helping_Fight-20|He said one of the main things the military learned was that the work of small teams proved to be more valuable than mass movements of troops and facilities. 
After_Helping_Fight-21|In the early days of the pandemic. 
After_Helping_Fight-22|The defense department sent hospital ships to new york city and los angeles. 
After_Helping_Fight-23|They also set up hospital operations in other states at the request of state leaders. 
After_Helping_Fight-24|The idea was to use the troops to treat non covid-19 patients so that hospitals could send her on more serious pandemic cases. 
After_Helping_Fight-25|But while images of the military ships were powerful. 
After_Helping_Fight-26|Many beds went unused. 
After_Helping_Fight-27|Fewer patients needed non covid-19 care than expected and hospitals were still overloaded by the pandemic. 
After_Helping_Fight-28|This led to changes in how military forces were deployed troops were sent to hospitals to fill in for overworked employees or to work alongside them in additional treatment areas. 
After_Helping_Fight-29|Lieutenant colonel suzanne copley lead an army team that was deployed to two hospitals in grand rapids michigan. 
After_Helping_Fight-30|From december to february. 
After_Helping_Fight-31|She spoke to associated press reporters about one patient the team helped at a michigan hospital as the omicron version of covid-19 was quickly spreading. 
After_Helping_Fight-32|The covid-19 patient was having severe breathing difficulties. 
After_Helping_Fight-33|But probably said all patient beds at the hospital we're full. 
After_Helping_Fight-34|An army nurse on her team knew of an open space in a temporary treatment area. 
After_Helping_Fight-35|The nurse quickly went into action. 
After_Helping_Fight-36|Hurrying to get the patient wheeled to the area. 
After_Helping_Fight-37|During the process the gurney struck a wall. 
After_Helping_Fight-38|Damaging it a little. 
After_Helping_Fight-39|When she saw what happened cobbley praised the nurses drive to help her patient. 
After_Helping_Fight-40|She's going to damage the wall on the way there. 
After_Helping_Fight-41|Because he's going to get that bed. 
After_Helping_Fight-42|Copley said. 
After_Helping_Fight-43|The patient is going to get the treatment he needs. 
After_Helping_Fight-44|That was the mission. 
After_Helping_Fight-45|The last military medical team deployed for the pandemic. 
After_Helping_Fight-46|Finished its assignment last week at the university of utah hospital. 
After_Helping_Fight-47|But officials say about 200 troops are being held on prepare to deploy orders through the end of may in case covid-19 infections rise again.

After_Wildfires-1|Climate change is fueling the spread of wildfires across the western united states. 
After_Wildfires-2|Scientists say. 
After_Wildfires-3|Researchers want to know how the fires might affect water supplies in the area. 
After_Wildfires-4|Communities often depend on melting snow in the spring as their water supply during dryer months. 
After_Wildfires-5|Studies show that snow in a burned forest. 
After_Wildfires-6|Belts up to several weeks earlier than snow in a healthy for us. 
After_Wildfires-7|The birds trees no longer provide much shade. 
After_Wildfires-8|And release small amounts of carbon. 
After_Wildfires-9|These conditions mean the snow absorbs or takes in. 
After_Wildfires-10|More sunlight. 
After_Wildfires-11|This makes it melt faster said and nolan. 
After_Wildfires-12|She researches how burned trees from forest fires. 
After_Wildfires-13|Effect snow melts for the university of nevada. 
After_Wildfires-14|If snow melts earlier than normal nolan said. 
After_Wildfires-15|That would likely leave less water flowing in the summer. 
After_Wildfires-16|When it is most needed. 
After_Wildfires-17|What are predictions look at conditions like snow density. 
After_Wildfires-18|Soil wetness and air temperature. 
After_Wildfires-19|Dust ash and soot similarly effect snow by causing it to absorb more light. 
After_Wildfires-20|That is called the albedo effect. 
After_Wildfires-21|But california officials are increasingly worried about carbon which absorbs even more. 
After_Wildfires-22|It was like okay we really need to understand this. 
After_Wildfires-23|This is the new norm. 
After_Wildfires-24|Said david rizardo. 
After_Wildfires-25|He is with the california department of water resources. 
After_Wildfires-26|In some fire damaged areas. 
After_Wildfires-27|State officials are beginning to create maps of snow. 
After_Wildfires-28|They use planes with cameras that can measure albedo. 
After_Wildfires-29|Already a warming climate is leading to earlier snowmelt. 
After_Wildfires-30|And leaving places more likely to have wildfires. 
After_Wildfires-31|Said no abolish. 
After_Wildfires-32|He researches water and snow at the university of colorado. 
After_Wildfires-33|A burned area worsens the effects of drought. 
After_Wildfires-34|By leading to even drier conditions in hotter months. 
After_Wildfires-35|He said. 
After_Wildfires-36|Nolan and student ariel kashtan worked in california's eldorado national forest. 
After_Wildfires-37|For one of their final research trips in early april. 
After_Wildfires-38|That is when the area usually has the most snow. 
After_Wildfires-39|What little remained when they arrived. 
After_Wildfires-40|In part because of unusually hot temperatures this spring. 
After_Wildfires-41|And many days without clouds. 
After_Wildfires-42|Late-season storms have since covered the area with several centimeters of new snow. 
After_Wildfires-43|This nolan said could help slow the melt. 
After_Wildfires-44|They called her fire that burned the area and more than 80,000 hector's last year. 
After_Wildfires-45|Has left nearby communities worried over water supply. 
After_Wildfires-46|About 65 km southwest from where nolan measured the snow. 
After_Wildfires-47|Since the town of grizzly flats. 
After_Wildfires-48|The town is working to fix a water pipeline damaged in the fire. 
After_Wildfires-49|The pipeline sends snow melt into a reservoir. 
After_Wildfires-50|Or man-made lake. 
After_Wildfires-51|Burn trees however keep falling and damaging the pipeline. 
After_Wildfires-52|It is not yet clear exactly how the burned trees might affect the town's water supply in the future. 
After_Wildfires-53|So far this year water managers said runoff from snowmelt appears normal. 
After_Wildfires-54|But officials do not know for sure because measuring devices were destroyed in the fire. 
After_Wildfires-55|Joe delouser is the general manager of the local water agency. 
After_Wildfires-56|She is concerned about the fires lasting effects. 
After_Wildfires-57|For now she said we are in survival mode.

Aid_Money-1|A recent study has followed the origins or beginnings of the family of languages that include modern japanese. 
Aid_Money-2|Korean. 
Aid_Money-3|Turkish. 
Aid_Money-4|And mongolian. 
Aid_Money-5|The findings show a shared genetic ancestry for the hundreds of millions of people who speak what's the researchers called trans-eurasian languages. 
Aid_Money-6|Such language has had their origin with millet farmers who lived in an area in northeastern china about 9,000 years ago. 
Aid_Money-7|Millet is a small round whole grain. 
Aid_Money-8|It was an important early crop as hunter-gatherers became farmers. 
Aid_Money-9|The study's findings show how the use of agriculture following the ice age. 
Aid_Money-10|Powered the movements of some of the world's major language families. 
Aid_Money-11|There are 98 trans-eurasian languages. 
Aid_Money-12|Among these are korean and japanese.

Aid_Money-41|Is a kind of surrender of identity. 
Aid_Money-42|Which some people are not yet prepared to make. 
Aid_Money-43|The researchers studied data vocabulary from the 90s.

Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-11|it's decided to stop producing the A380 in 2019
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-12|as Airlines became more likely to purchase smaller models
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-13|Emirates Airline is by far are buses largest buyer
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-14|the airline still believes in the super jumbo Jets ability to appeal to passengers
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-15|even though no more a380s will be built
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-16|Emirates will keep flying them for years
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-17|but many airlines disagree and stopped flying the A380 during the covid-19 pandemic
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-18|Emirates Airline president Tim Clark disagrees with critics who say the days of large four-engine planes
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-19|like the A380 are in the past
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-20|I don't share that view at all
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-21|Clark recently told reporters
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-22|and I still believe there is a place for the A380
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-23|he added that the traveling public absolutely loves that airplane
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-24|talks to build the plane began in 2000
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-25|it was meant to be airbus's 21st century answer to Boeing's 1960s jumbo jet
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-26|2747
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-27|the A380 has quiet Rolls Royce engines placed far out on its longwings
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-28|the body of the plane is lights and easy to control
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-29|the plane was a symbol around the world of European technology
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-30|but it was costly to make and did not become very popular with Airlines
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-31|the A380 lost the company 522 million dollars in 2018
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-32|Airbus decided to Halt production a year later

Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-37|which led to deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-38|the first delivery of the A380 came in 2007
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-39|more than two years later than expected
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-40|when Emirates got its first A380 a year later
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-41|the financial crisis hit
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-42|sales for the biggest planes fell
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-43|Airlines seemed more interested in midsize planes for shorter trips
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-44|even on longer trips
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-45|Airlines seems to prefer smaller planes that were easier to fill with passengers
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-46|Boeing began selling models of its smaller 787 Dreamliner
Airbus_Delivers_Last_Superjumbo_Airplane-47|which was later followed by the Airbus a350

American_Companies-1|In 1988. 
American_Companies-2|The percentage of us adults age. 
American_Companies-3|25 or older. 
American_Companies-4|With a college degree. 
American_Companies-5|Reached. 
American_Companies-6|20%. 
American_Companies-7|For the first time. 
American_Companies-8|That information comes from the national center for education statistics. 
American_Companies-9|Many people consider a degree. 
American_Companies-10|From a four-year college to be an important step. 
American_Companies-11|Toward a good job. 
American_Companies-12|Employers. 
American_Companies-13|Have used the credential. 
American_Companies-14|To help choose between job candidates. 
American_Companies-15|Experts who study labor and higher education. 
American_Companies-16|Have said a college degree tells businesses. 
American_Companies-17|That their employees have basic work skills. 
American_Companies-18|But by 2019. 
American_Companies-19|The number of adults with college degrees. 
American_Companies-20|Increased to 36%. 
American_Companies-21|That is a rise of 80% over 30 years. 
American_Companies-22|A 2019 story in the wall street journal newspaper. 
American_Companies-23|Call this increase. 
American_Companies-24|Degree inflation. 
American_Companies-25|That meant the credential had become less valuable because it was so common. 
American_Companies-26|However. 
American_Companies-27|Many businesses still use a college degree as a filter. 
American_Companies-28|In choosing possible workers. 
American_Companies-29|Wellmore american workers have a college degree. 
American_Companies-30|Then in the 1980s. 
American_Companies-31|There are still millions of experienced workers. 
American_Companies-32|Who do not have one. 
American_Companies-33|People who study labor. 
American_Companies-34|Say dependence on a college degree creates a needless barrier. 
American_Companies-35|Byron auguste is one of them. 
American_Companies-36|Oakiest is an economist and the labor expert. 
American_Companies-37|He was an adviser to former president barack obama. 
American_Companies-38|In 2015. 
American_Companies-39|He helped start a company called opportunity at work. 
American_Companies-40|It aims to help skilled workers in the us. 
American_Companies-41|Who do not have college degrees. 
American_Companies-42|Find good jobs. 
American_Companies-43|Auguste tells the story of his father. 
American_Companies-44|Who took computer classes. 
American_Companies-45|His father then went on to have a successful computer programming career. 
American_Companies-46|But he did not have a college degree. 
American_Companies-47|Auguste calls workers like his father. 
American_Companies-48|Stars. 
American_Companies-49|It stands for. 
American_Companies-50|Skilled through alternative routes. 
American_Companies-51|That means they use different paths to get the skills and knowledge. 
American_Companies-52|They need to do a job. 
American_Companies-53|His company's research shows the three main groups of stars are african-americans. 
American_Companies-54|Hispanics and rural people. 
American_Companies-55|Oggi's recently wrote an opinion piece. 
American_Companies-56|For the washington post newspaper. 
American_Companies-57|He later spoke about his work in a podcast. 
American_Companies-58|He said the college degree filter creates a skills gap. 
American_Companies-59|The lack of a degree makes employers thing. 
American_Companies-60|There are not enough workers to do some jobs. 
American_Companies-61|But in fact. 
American_Companies-62|There are workers with the needed skills. 
American_Companies-63|Most of the skills we use at work we learn on the job. 
American_Companies-64|Not in school. 
American_Companies-65|So we stop people from having that experience on the job. 
American_Companies-66|Well then obviously we're going to work our way into a skills gap i think that's exactly what we've done. 
American_Companies-67|Some jobs clearly requires special degrees and training such as the professions of medicine or law. 
American_Companies-68|However. 
American_Companies-69|There are millions of good workers in the us who have valuable experience said christian sarah. 
American_Companies-70|He works with auguste at opportunity at work. 
American_Companies-71|Sarah said. 
American_Companies-72|They may have jobs at large stores like walmart. 
American_Companies-73|And could move into better jobs with a little special training. 
American_Companies-74|Sarah said. 
American_Companies-75|Many of these people speak english. 
American_Companies-76|And another language. 
American_Companies-77|He gave an example of someone who needs to work with people who can speak both english and spanish. 
American_Companies-78|He said an immigrant has skills people cannot learn in college. 
American_Companies-79|Like patience and not taking things too personally and had a little bit of humor about life in general as you're running about a different culture different country different everything. 
American_Companies-80|A company he said that is flexible and its hiring methods. 
American_Companies-81|Can identify a good worker. 
American_Companies-82|And then train them for a better job. 
American_Companies-83|Auguste recently spoke with the new york times newspaper he said. 
American_Companies-84|People need dependable jobs. 
American_Companies-85|To enter the middle class. 
American_Companies-86|If companies continue four-year degree requirements. 
American_Companies-87|Millions of people will not be able to get better jobs. 
American_Companies-88|Sarah move. 
American_Companies-89|To the us from spain without a college degree. 
American_Companies-90|He found that if you wanted to have a good job he would need to find a way to finish college. 
American_Companies-91|He did that. 
American_Companies-92|But it was not easy he started. 
American_Companies-93|By attending a community college. 
American_Companies-94|Many people will still need to push themselves to get a college degree he said. 
American_Companies-95|However. 
American_Companies-96|Companies like opportunity at work. 
American_Companies-97|Are asking businesses to reconsider their job requirements. 
American_Companies-98|A recent story by the harvard business review. 
American_Companies-99|Noted that during the covid-19 health crisis. 
American_Companies-100|Some companies removed a college degree from their list of job requirements. 
American_Companies-101|Before that. 
American_Companies-102|A 2018 story by cnbc. 
American_Companies-103|Noted that companies including google apple. 
American_Companies-104|Ibm and starbucks. 
American_Companies-105|We're removing college degree requirements from some job listings. 
American_Companies-106|Sarah said. 
American_Companies-107|Many of those jobs are. 
American_Companies-108|Show your work jobs. 
American_Companies-109|Like writing programming for computers. 
American_Companies-110|But he said there are still other jobs where people who have work experience without a degree. 
American_Companies-111|Can succeed. 
American_Companies-112|Also he said companies need to tell their employees. 
American_Companies-113|About opportunities for them to get better jobs. 
American_Companies-114|And. 
American_Companies-115|To make it easier for good workers to be considered for them. 
American_Companies-116|Sarah called on employers. 
American_Companies-117|To offer jobs with mid-level pay. 
American_Companies-118|And good job possibilities to stars. 
American_Companies-119|He said that stars answer. 
American_Companies-120|When employers send a strong signal that they need workers with skills. 
American_Companies-121|And do not require a college degree. 
American_Companies-122|But as of right now and tories are failing to turn the signal on and commit to action. 
American_Companies-123|That he added. 
American_Companies-124|Prevents stars from taking action. 
American_Companies-125|And keeps them on the sidelines.

American_Women_Soccer-1|Professional soccer players in the united states have reached an historic agreement with the sport's governing body. 
American_Women_Soccer-2|The deal marks the end of a six-year legal battle over equal pay. 
American_Women_Soccer-3|For male and female players. 
American_Women_Soccer-4|The deal promises female players 24 million dollars plus bonuses that are equal to what male soccer players receive. 
American_Women_Soccer-5|A bonus is extra money given to players for doing well at major competitions. 
American_Women_Soccer-6|The us soccer federation. 
American_Women_Soccer-7|Or ussf. 
American_Women_Soccer-8|And the women announced the deal tuesday. 
American_Women_Soccer-9|The women will divide 22 million dollars about one-third of what they had sought in damages. 
American_Women_Soccer-10|The ussf also agreed to establish a separate fund of $2000000. 
American_Women_Soccer-11|The money will be used to support players after their careers end. 
American_Women_Soccer-12|As well as help grow the sport of women's soccer. 
American_Women_Soccer-13|The ussf promised to provide an equal rate of pay. 
American_Women_Soccer-14|For the women's and men's national teams. 
American_Women_Soccer-15|Including world cup bonuses. 
American_Women_Soccer-16|For our generation knowing that we are going to leave the game in an exponentially better place than when we found it. 
American_Women_Soccer-17|Is everything. 
American_Women_Soccer-18|Soccer player megan rapinoe told the associated press. 
American_Women_Soccer-19|That's what it's all about because to be honest there is no justice in all of this if we don't make sure it never happens again. 
American_Women_Soccer-20|Ussf president cindy parlow cone said. 
American_Women_Soccer-21|This is just one step towards rebuilding the relationship with the women's team. 
American_Women_Soccer-22|Cone became head of the federation in march 2020. 
American_Women_Soccer-23|She replaced carlos cordeiro as president. 
American_Women_Soccer-24|He resigned after the federation claimed in court that women players had less physical ability and responsibilities than male players.

Americans_View_how-59|Sprites are added. 
Americans_View_how-60|That one of the best things that biden administration can do to help international students. 
Americans_View_how-61|Is the send clear messages.

Americans_View_how-69|Students make long-term decisions about their education. 
Americans_View_how-70|And might not come to the us if programs such as optional practical training get taken away. 
Americans_View_how-71|And for students. 
Americans_View_how-72|Who already were in the middle of their studies. 
Americans_View_how-73|It is difficult to deal with. 
Americans_View_how-74|Fast policy change. 
Americans_View_how-75|While the biden administration is more welcoming with international students. 
Americans_View_how-76|Fisher the higher education writer.

Americans_View_how-83|They were accused of hiding their ties to the chinese military. 
Americans_View_how-84|While the cases may not seem directly related to international students.

Artist_Plans_City-21|With help from conservation groups and. 
Artist_Plans_City-22|U.s. geological survey data. 
Artist_Plans_City-23|Would tell time in a very different way. 
Artist_Plans_City-24|The natural flow of georgia's waterways would be shown on a large city clock in downtown atlanta. 
Artist_Plans_City-25|Ideally people will get into the water to observe. 
Artist_Plans_City-26|And to consider the effects of the flow of water. 
Artist_Plans_City-27|Underworld. 
Artist_Plans_City-28|As well as the causes of that flow. 
Artist_Plans_City-29|Keeps told the associated press. 
Artist_Plans_City-30|He wants people to think not only about time. 
Artist_Plans_City-31|But about how we live in the world. 
Artist_Plans_City-32|Kids has led classes since the fall of 2021. 
Artist_Plans_City-33|To teach people how to use handmade materials. 
Artist_Plans_City-34|To record flow rates. 
Artist_Plans_City-35|To bring his idea into reality. 
Artist_Plans_City-36|He hopes to build a mechanical clock. 
Artist_Plans_City-37|That uses a pendulum. 
Artist_Plans_City-38|Pendulum is a stick with a weight on one end. 
Artist_Plans_City-39|That moves back and forth regularly to keep time. 
Artist_Plans_City-40|Every year people would travel to the source of the chattahoochee river. 
Artist_Plans_City-41|And measure the water flow. 
Artist_Plans_City-42|They would change the movement of the pendulum. 
Artist_Plans_City-43|Based on the water's movement. 
Artist_Plans_City-44|Why use waterways when we have clocks. 
Artist_Plans_City-45|Smartphones computers and watches. 
Artist_Plans_City-46|Telling us the time already. 
Artist_Plans_City-47|Keith says he does not use a mobile phone. 
Artist_Plans_City-48|But he has thought a lot about such questions. 
Artist_Plans_City-49|Well walking along georgia's red-clay riverbanks. 
Artist_Plans_City-50|All of this is a story that we can tell. 
Artist_Plans_City-51|And a story allows us. 
Artist_Plans_City-52|To reflect on ourselves. 
Artist_Plans_City-53|As a result of that. 
Artist_Plans_City-54|Of that path that we take. 
Artist_Plans_City-55|Keep said. 
Artist_Plans_City-56|The artist earlier art projects. 
Artist_Plans_City-57|Included selling imaginary lands. 
Artist_Plans_City-58|And opening a restaurant that serves special sunlight to plants. 
Artist_Plans_City-59|He put a millennium camera in a tall building at amherst college. 
Artist_Plans_City-60|But he said would record climate change. 
Artist_Plans_City-61|To a 1000-year photograph of a mountain range. 
Artist_Plans_City-62|Keith has placed similar cameras at lake tahoe. 
Artist_Plans_City-63|And arizona state university. 
Artist_Plans_City-64|Keats was invited to be the artist-in-residence. 
Artist_Plans_City-65|At serenbe. 
Artist_Plans_City-66|The planned community just outside atlanta. 
Artist_Plans_City-67|Along with teaching classes. 
Artist_Plans_City-68|He can enjoy the natural surroundings nearby. 
Artist_Plans_City-69|This participants recently. 
Artist_Plans_City-70|Maples of clay. 
Artist_Plans_City-71|And made record books using colored paper. 
Artist_Plans_City-72|Then they all traveled to south fork peachtree creek. 
Artist_Plans_City-73|There they watched leaves float along with the water. 
Artist_Plans_City-74|The time the movement of the leaves by letting water run out through holes in their bowls. 
Artist_Plans_City-75|It is a simple way to measure flow rate. 
Artist_Plans_City-76|But keith's hopes it will help people look differently. 
Artist_Plans_City-77|And how humans interact with nature. 
Artist_Plans_City-78|I believe that the rivers and streams and creeks. 
Artist_Plans_City-79|In and around atlanta. 
Artist_Plans_City-80|Are a natural resource. 
Artist_Plans_City-81|It helps us to see ourselves in relation.

Artistic_Advanced-1|Schools in the united states are welcoming back students to classrooms this autumn. 
Artistic_Advanced-2|But they are facing a new problem. 
Artistic_Advanced-3|A shortage of teachers and school workers. 
Artistic_Advanced-4|Districts have faced shortages before. 
Artistic_Advanced-5|But many now say it is the worst it has ever been. 
Artistic_Advanced-6|The country's public schools have struggled for years with teacher shortages. 
Artistic_Advanced-7|Especially in math. 
Artistic_Advanced-8|Science. 
Artistic_Advanced-9|Special education and languages. 
Artistic_Advanced-10|But the covid-19 crisis has worsened the problem. 
Artistic_Advanced-11|The pandemic has led to an increase in retirement. 
Artistic_Advanced-12|And resignations. 
Artistic_Advanced-13|Districts across the country are reporting teacher shortages. 
Artistic_Advanced-14|In south dakota. 
Artistic_Advanced-15|One district started the school year. 
Artistic_Advanced-16|With 120 unfilled teacher positions. 
Artistic_Advanced-17|Across texas the main districts in the cities of houston and waco. 
Artistic_Advanced-18|Reported hundreds of teacher openings. 
Artistic_Advanced-19|At the start of the year. 
Artistic_Advanced-20|Many schools across the country. 
Artistic_Advanced-21|Have had to close classrooms because of a lack of teachers. 
Artistic_Advanced-22|In michigan. 
Artistic_Advanced-23|Eastpointe community schools. 
Artistic_Advanced-24|Moved its middle school back to online learning last week. 
Artistic_Advanced-25|Because it does not have enough teachers. 
Artistic_Advanced-26|The small district north of detroit. 
Artistic_Advanced-27|Has 43 positions open. 
Artistic_Advanced-28|One-quarter of its teachers. 
Artistic_Advanced-29|When several middle school teachers resigned last week. 
Artistic_Advanced-30|The district started teaching online classes. 
Artistic_Advanced-31|To avoid sending in inexperienced substitute teachers. 
Artistic_Advanced-32|Said spokeswoman caitlin quinones. 
Artistic_Advanced-33|This is obviously not ideal. 
Artistic_Advanced-34|But we're able to make sure they're getting each subject area. 
Artistic_Advanced-35|From a teacher certified to teach it. 
Artistic_Advanced-36|Kenneth said. 
Artistic_Advanced-37|The national education association. 
Artistic_Advanced-38|Surveyed 2690 educators in june. 
Artistic_Advanced-39|32%. 
Artistic_Advanced-40|Said the pandemic drove them to leave teaching earlier than expected. 
Artistic_Advanced-41|Another survey by the rand corporation. 
Artistic_Advanced-42|Found that teachers had high levels of stress. 
Artistic_Advanced-43|And were three times more likely than adults in other professions. 
Artistic_Advanced-44|To experience depression. 
Artistic_Advanced-45|A school district in california west contra costa county. 
Artistic_Advanced-46|Is considering hiring out-of-state math educators. 
Artistic_Advanced-47|To teach online. 
Artistic_Advanced-48|While a substitute teacher watches students in person. 
Artistic_Advanced-49|This is the worst shortage of labour we have ever had. 
Artistic_Advanced-50|Said assistant superintendent tony world. 
Artistic_Advanced-51|We opened this year with 50 teaching positions open. 
Artistic_Advanced-52|That means students are going to 50 classrooms. 
Artistic_Advanced-53|That do not have a permanent teacher. 
Artistic_Advanced-54|There are 100 more openings for aids to help teach english learners. 
Artistic_Advanced-55|And special needs students. 
Artistic_Advanced-56|There is also a shortage of cleaners. 
Artistic_Advanced-57|Food services workers and others. 
Artistic_Advanced-58|Well said. 
Artistic_Advanced-59|Money is not the main problem. 
Artistic_Advanced-60|School districts have the money to employ more teachers and workers. 
Artistic_Advanced-61|Thanks to billions of dollars in federal and state pandemic relief assistance. 
Artistic_Advanced-62|There are just not enough people looking for work. 
Artistic_Advanced-63|Mike gilbert is the assistant superintendent at the morongo unified school district in southern california. 
Artistic_Advanced-64|We are all competing for a shrinking piece of the pie. 
Artistic_Advanced-65|I don't know if everybody is getting snatched up. 
Artistic_Advanced-66|Or if they don't want to teach during covid he said. 
Artistic_Advanced-67|The morongo school district of 8000 students. 
Artistic_Advanced-68|Has put job advertisements in newspapers. 
Artistic_Advanced-69|Radio and social media. 
Artistic_Advanced-70|Teachers have also put now hiring messages. 
Artistic_Advanced-71|Into their students lunch containers. 
Artistic_Advanced-72|The messages include a list of openings. 
Artistic_Advanced-73|Class sizes are also getting bigger. 
Artistic_Advanced-74|Mount diablo unified school district serves 28,000 students. 
Artistic_Advanced-75|Near san francisco california. 
Artistic_Advanced-76|It has had to fill several elementary school classroom. 
Artistic_Advanced-77|At 32 students. 
Artistic_Advanced-78|The most students there can be. 
Artistic_Advanced-79|At first. 
Artistic_Advanced-80|About 150 children signed up for online learning. 
Artistic_Advanced-81|But with covid-19 infections rising. 
Artistic_Advanced-82|The number increased to 600 by the time school begin. 
Artistic_Advanced-83|The same happened in fresno. 
Artistic_Advanced-84|Where enrollment in online learning went from 450. 
Artistic_Advanced-85|To 3800. 
Artistic_Advanced-86|By the time school started. 
Artistic_Advanced-87|Of the 12 officials interviewed by the associated press in california districts. 
Artistic_Advanced-88|Only one said it was not facing shortages. 
Artistic_Advanced-89|Long beach unified the state's fourth-largest district. 
Artistic_Advanced-90|Was prepared for the worker shortage. 
Artistic_Advanced-91|Last spring it worked hard to hire 400 more teachers. 
Artistic_Advanced-92|We probably would have experienced the same shortages as others. 
Artistic_Advanced-93|Said long beach assistant superintendent. 
Artistic_Advanced-94|David zaid. 
Artistic_Advanced-95|But we became much more assertive. 
Artistic_Advanced-96|And as a result. 
Artistic_Advanced-97|We are not in the same position. 
Artistic_Advanced-98|I'm getting over.

Baby_Doing_Well-1|Doctors at duke university in the american state of north carolina announced that a baby boy is doing well after a new kind of operation to replace his heart. 
Baby_Doing_Well-2|The heart transplant operation doctor set. 
Baby_Doing_Well-3|Included special tissue to help prevent rejection of the new organ. 
Baby_Doing_Well-4|The tissue came from another person's famous gland and was partly grown in a laboratory. 
Baby_Doing_Well-5|The thymus gland is an organ that plays an important part in the immune system. 
Baby_Doing_Well-6|Which fights infection and disease in the human body. 
Baby_Doing_Well-7|Doctors have wondered if implanting thymus tissue that matched a donated organ might help it survive without requiring anti-rejection medicine. 
Baby_Doing_Well-8|Those medicines can have harmful effects on the body. 
Baby_Doing_Well-9|Easton cinnamon of asheboro north carolina received his transplant last summer when he was 6 months old. 
Baby_Doing_Well-10|But duke university waited to announce the operation. 
Baby_Doing_Well-11|Until after doctors learned whether the thymus implants were working. 
Baby_Doing_Well-12|They hoped the implants would begin producing immune cells that do not treat the child's newhart like foreign tissue. 
Baby_Doing_Well-13|After sometime. 
Baby_Doing_Well-14|Doctors will try taking easton off the immune-suppressing drugs required after a transplant. 
Baby_Doing_Well-15|Said dr. joseph turek. 
Baby_Doing_Well-16|He is duke university's head of children's heart surgery. 
Baby_Doing_Well-17|The research is in its very early stages. 
Baby_Doing_Well-18|It is one possible method scientists are testing to produce what is called immune tolerance to a transplant. 
Baby_Doing_Well-19|Drake sad if it works the method could be tried with other organ transplants not just the heart. 
Baby_Doing_Well-20|Easton was a candidate for the experimental transplant because he had to separate health problems. 
Baby_Doing_Well-21|He was born with some heart problems that surgeries right after birth failed to solve. 
Baby_Doing_Well-22|And he suffered repeated infections that doctors realized meant his own thymus was not working correctly. 
Baby_Doing_Well-23|Some babies are born without a thymus which helps in development of part of the immune system known as t-cells. 
Baby_Doing_Well-24|Duke researchers have been working with ends of aunt therapeutics to develop in plants grown in a laboratory with donated famous tissue. 
Baby_Doing_Well-25|In fact. 
Baby_Doing_Well-26|Easton received two operations. 
Baby_Doing_Well-27|First. 
Baby_Doing_Well-28|Surgeons implanted his newhart while the donated thymus was sent to a laboratory. 
Baby_Doing_Well-29|About two weeks later. 
Baby_Doing_Well-30|He had a second operation to implant the processed thymus tissue. 
Baby_Doing_Well-31|Is only partly working by miss was removed so that new immune cells can develop. 
Baby_Doing_Well-32|About six months later. 
Baby_Doing_Well-33|Testing shows the thymus tissue is building easton new well working t-cells.

Berkeley_Forced-1|The university of california-berkeley called the state's recent supreme court ruling. 
Berkeley_Forced-2|Devastating news for students who have earned a seat in the class for the upcoming school year. 
Berkeley_Forced-3|The state's highest court. 
Berkeley_Forced-4|Chose not to look at a case. 
Berkeley_Forced-5|First decided in the summer of 2021. 
Berkeley_Forced-6|That is when a lower court said. 
Berkeley_Forced-7|The university must limit the number of students on its campus. 
Berkeley_Forced-8|To about 42,000. 
Berkeley_Forced-9|For the 2020 to 2023 school year. 
Berkeley_Forced-10|Right now. 
Berkeley_Forced-11|About 45,000 students are at uc berkeley. 
Berkeley_Forced-12|Uc-berkeley is one of the top public universities in the united states. 
Berkeley_Forced-13|The school said it received over 128000 applications. 
Berkeley_Forced-14|For the upcoming freshman class. 
Berkeley_Forced-15|Border to meet the lower number. 
Berkeley_Forced-16|The university said it would bring in more students who live in california. 
Berkeley_Forced-17|As a result. 
Berkeley_Forced-18|International students and those from other american states. 
Berkeley_Forced-19|Could get fewer seats. 
Berkeley_Forced-20|In addition the university said it would ask some students to take classes from home. 
Berkeley_Forced-21|Early in the school year before coming to campus in 2023. 
Berkeley_Forced-22|Others will have to wait one year to start their college education. 
Berkeley_Forced-23|If they still want to come to berkeley. 
Berkeley_Forced-24|The university is also asking students to consider. 
Berkeley_Forced-25|Off-campus study programs. 
Berkeley_Forced-26|In sacramento. 
Berkeley_Forced-27|The state's capital. 
Berkeley_Forced-28|Or washington dc. 
Berkeley_Forced-29|The legal case was brought by a group of people who live in the city of berkeley. 
Berkeley_Forced-30|They formed an organization called save berkeley's neighborhoods or svn. 
Berkeley_Forced-31|The group said the university had not been truthful. 
Berkeley_Forced-32|About the number of students at meant to accept each year. 
Berkeley_Forced-33|It also said the school did not consider. 
Berkeley_Forced-34|How its increasing enrollment. 
Berkeley_Forced-35|What effect the surrounding neighborhoods. 
Berkeley_Forced-36|Uc-berkeley like several california schools does not have enough housing for its increasing enrollment. 
Berkeley_Forced-37|Espn said. 
Berkeley_Forced-38|The university planned in 2005. 
Berkeley_Forced-39|To increase the number of students on campus. 
Berkeley_Forced-40|Play only 1650. 
Berkeley_Forced-41|Over 15 years. 
Berkeley_Forced-42|However as of 2018. 
Berkeley_Forced-43|The number of students increased by over 8,000. 
Berkeley_Forced-44|Without enough new housing. 
Berkeley_Forced-45|The larger amount of students as being said. 
Berkeley_Forced-46|Caused an increase in noise and waste. 
Berkeley_Forced-47|Because they could not live at school. 
Berkeley_Forced-48|They moved into the neighborhoods around the school. 
Berkeley_Forced-49|Causing higher housing costs. 
Berkeley_Forced-50|As a result. 
Berkeley_Forced-51|Spns. 
Berkeley_Forced-52|The local court to restrict the school's enrollment. 
Berkeley_Forced-53|The situation in berkeley is similar to other disputes between large california universities and their cities. 
Berkeley_Forced-54|The cities of los angeles. 
Berkeley_Forced-55|San diego and santa barbara. 
Berkeley_Forced-56|Are also dealing with increasing numbers. 
Berkeley_Forced-57|Of students. 
Berkeley_Forced-58|And universities that do not have enough housing. 
Berkeley_Forced-59|In recent years california state leaders have been working to help more students get into college. 
Berkeley_Forced-60|In 2021 they added 47 billion dollars. 
Berkeley_Forced-61|In education-related spending. 
Berkeley_Forced-62|To increase the number of students going to public colleges. 
Berkeley_Forced-63|Groups like espeon. 
Berkeley_Forced-64|Say the state has not required universities. 
Berkeley_Forced-65|To build more housing. 
Berkeley_Forced-66|While it has been pushing them to accept more students. 
Berkeley_Forced-67|On the other side universities like uc berkeley. 
Berkeley_Forced-68|Say environmental restrictions in california. 
Berkeley_Forced-69|Make it difficult for them to build new housing for students. 
Berkeley_Forced-70|Save berkeley's neighborhoods argued that uc berkeley's failure to limit the number of students violates a state environmental law. 
Berkeley_Forced-71|Put in place in 1970. 
Berkeley_Forced-72|And the school said. 
Berkeley_Forced-73|Lengthy environmental reviews for new buildings. 
Berkeley_Forced-74|Have limited its attempts to build more housing for students. 
Berkeley_Forced-75|State lawmaker scott wiener. 
Berkeley_Forced-76|Said he would find a way to permit colleges. 
Berkeley_Forced-77|To build student housing more easily. 
Berkeley_Forced-78|When the california supreme court. 
Berkeley_Forced-79|Said it would not review the lower court's decision. 
Berkeley_Forced-80|Espn offered to work with uc berkeley. 
Berkeley_Forced-81|To prevent 1,000 more students for the upcoming school year. 
Berkeley_Forced-82|If most of them were from california. 
Berkeley_Forced-83|The university declined the offer. 
Berkeley_Forced-84|A spokesperson told the local newspaper that decisions on the number of students. 
Berkeley_Forced-85|Are made by elected officials and school leaders. 
Berkeley_Forced-86|And not by a small group. 
Berkeley_Forced-87|The university also plans to appeal the decision later this year. 
Berkeley_Forced-88|Jesse lives he recently completed his advanced studies in physics at uc berkeley. 
Berkeley_Forced-89|He said he does not believe there is a serious conflict. 
Berkeley_Forced-90|Between the university and the city.

Breaking-1|As the number of english learners in american schools continues to rise. 
Breaking-2|It is not just students that are going to need more help. 
Breaking-3|Parents and families that do not speak english also need support. 
Breaking-4|Say school officials. 
Breaking-5|Parents need to feel like they can be actively involved in their child's schooling. 
Breaking-6|Regardless of any language barriers. 
Breaking-7|And it is on us as a district to create that space for families to be involved. 
Breaking-8|Said leonor vargas. 
Breaking-9|She is an administrator with the austin independent school district in texas. 
Breaking-10|We're almost 30% of the student population are english learners. 
Breaking-11|She and principle janet huger johnson of the east new york elementary school of excellence. 
Breaking-12|Shared their experiences last week in an online discussion with the news organization education week. 
Breaking-13|It is important for parents and families to be able to communicate and their desired language. 
Breaking-14|Johnson said her school for example. 
Breaking-15|Uses a phone app that permits teachers and administrators to send messages in english. 
Breaking-16|That will translate to the parents language. 
Breaking-17|And when the parent responds the message is translated back into english. 
Breaking-18|She added that sometimes the school will need to hire people in the community to help with translation. 
Breaking-19|Beyond language barriers. 
Breaking-20|Parents and family members. 
Breaking-21|Should feel like they are part of the school community. 
Breaking-22|Officials said. 
Breaking-23|That means getting to know every family through online. 
Breaking-24|Or in-person meetings. 
Breaking-25|And creating space for parents from similar backgrounds. 
Breaking-26|To communicate with each other about their concerns. 
Breaking-27|This said. 
Breaking-28|Just asking parents simple questions like what their child's dreams are. 
Breaking-29|Or what their child is good at. 
Breaking-30|Will quickly start a conversation. 
Breaking-31|They have to believe that the educational system. 
Breaking-32|It's not stop at the school store. 
Breaking-33|Johnson said. 
Breaking-34|They have to believe. 
Breaking-35|That it's no different than where they came from. 
Breaking-36|Understanding cultural differences is also important. 
Breaking-37|Vargas shared a story from her district. 
Breaking-38|Where some afghan students. 
Breaking-39|We're not eating food provided by the school. 
Breaking-40|After speaking with the families. 
Breaking-41|The teachers found the students were not eating. 
Breaking-42|Because they were unfamiliar with the food. 
Breaking-43|So bogguss and other school teachers. 
Breaking-44|Will soon hold an event. 
Breaking-45|Where families can teach the food. 
Breaking-46|And know what their children are eating. 
Breaking-47|Schools will also start sending home translated menus. 
Breaking-48|Schools in find value in education through their culture. 
Breaking-49|Johnson said. 
Breaking-50|Parents that do not speak english. 
Breaking-51|Need to feel that they are equal. 
Breaking-52|Any other parent in the school community. 
Breaking-53|They said. 
Breaking-54|And. 
Breaking-55|Is schools do not offer support to families. 
Breaking-56|The results can cause problems. 
Breaking-57|A recent investigation by the associated press. 
Breaking-58|Found that schools in the city of philadelphia. 
Breaking-59|Lawson provide little support immigrant parents. 
Breaking-60|Some parents said the school system offered poor translation services. 
Breaking-61|Mandy is apparent in philadelphia who speaks mandarin. 
Breaking-62|Child has special needs. 
Breaking-63|She told the ap. 
Breaking-64|That during one meeting. 
Breaking-65|Telephone translator said. 
Breaking-66|She did not know anything about special education and refused to translate. 
Breaking-67|Recently she had to bring a friend to the school to translate during the school meeting. 
Breaking-68|It feels like immigrant parents are deliberately excluded and pushed to the margins and he said. 
Breaking-69|Students in english education programs are a large and growing population in american schools. 
Breaking-70|The us department of education says that the number of english learners. 
Breaking-71|Increased by more than 1 million from 2000 to 2020. 
Breaking-72|43 states saw increases in english learners over that time. 
Breaking-73|And us census data showed that the number of people who speak languages other than english at home. 
Breaking-74|Increased by more than 8 million over the last 10 years. 
Breaking-75|Almost 22% of american households. 
Breaking-76|Speak a foreign language at home. 
Breaking-77|The department of education office of civil rights requires schools to provide translation services. 
Breaking-78|Two families in whatever language they speak. 
Breaking-79|Schools must not use other students to translate. 
Breaking-80|Or use other untrained workers. 
Breaking-81|In philadelphia however. 
Breaking-82|The ap found that schools often use students for translation. 
Breaking-83|Olivia ponton. 
Breaking-84|Another parents in philadelphia. 
Breaking-85|Also had problems with language. 
Breaking-86|She tried to talk to a school official when her daughter was being bullied at school. 
Breaking-87|The school's translator was not available. 
Breaking-88|So the official had another spanish-speaking student translate. 
Breaking-89|The student did not translate well. 
Breaking-90|And the discussion went poorly. 
Breaking-91|Ponse kept her daughter home for a week. 
Breaking-92|I didn't know we had rights and that they couldn't take students out of class to help translate for us. 
Breaking-93|They never told us this. 
Breaking-94|Ponse told the ap. 
Breaking-95|What i want. 
Breaking-96|Is for parents to know that when their children start in education. 
Breaking-97|They have a right to be a part of it. 
Breaking-98|I'm doing novak.

Britain_Marks_70_Years-23|That the sun never sets on the british empire. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-24|Historians estimated the empire once ruled more than 400 million people. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-25|It had 25% of the earth's land mass. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-26|It was so huge. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-27|But there was always daylight in one of the territories. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-28|Under elizabeth.

Britain_Marks_70_Years-38|Including australia new zealand and canada. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-39|Elizabeth's rule has often been compared. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-40|Good or bad to the golden age of the first elizabeth in the 16th century. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-41|That was a time when england grew its economy.

Britain_Marks_70_Years-47|I say this not as criticism. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-48|But simply as a statement of fact. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-49|For she came to the throne with one thought only. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-50|To keep the royal show on the road. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-51|Anna whitelock is professor of the history of monarchy. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-52|At london's city university.

Britain_Marks_70_Years-55|And ensure the succession. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-56|That is the primary job. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-57|And that's what she's done. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-58|Matthew dennison recently wrote a book about the queen. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-59|He said the way elizabeth performs her role. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-60|Has given her a moral position beyond anything she had as a monarch. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-61|Constitutionally. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-62|The british monarch now has few practical powers. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-63|It is expected to be non-political. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-64|However. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-65|Historians say elizabeth has used soft power. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-66|It made the monarchy a unifying force for the nation. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-67|At the start of the covid-19 pandemic. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-68|The queen used her broadcast to calm the public. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-69|Former british leaders have said her years of experience.

Britain_Marks_70_Years-73|She will assess situations and difficulties. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-74|And can describe them without ever giving any clue as to political preference or anything like that. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-75|It's quite remarkable to see. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-76|Some historians say the queen will be viewed as the last of her kind. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-77|A monarch who commands unquestioned respect. 
Britain_Marks_70_Years-78|And whitelock observed that she the queen.

British_Museum-1|I knew show at the british museum in london explores the mystery of stonehenge. 
British_Museum-2|The famous ancient circle of stones. 
British_Museum-3|In southern england. 
British_Museum-4|The huge stones are believed to have been put in place. 
British_Museum-5|Between 5000 and 3500 years ago. 
British_Museum-6|The purpose of the circle is still debated. 
British_Museum-7|Was stonehenge meant as a sundial. 
British_Museum-8|A burial ground. 
British_Museum-9|A memorial or something else. 
British_Museum-10|Neil wilkin is believed curator of the show called. 
British_Museum-11|The world of stonehenge. 
British_Museum-12|We all feel we know stonehenge he said. 
British_Museum-13|We visit as school children. 
British_Museum-14|Or bring our kids to see it. 
British_Museum-15|But often we don't know much or feel like we don't know much. 
British_Museum-16|About the world. 
British_Museum-17|The people who built the monuments and who came to worship at the monument. 
British_Museum-18|The world of stonehenge exhibition brings together more than 430 object. 
British_Museum-19|From across europe. 
British_Museum-20|To explore the monuments creators and bear world. 
British_Museum-21|It was a time of radical change. 
British_Museum-22|That's our technological development. 
British_Museum-23|Major migrations. 
British_Museum-24|And social change. 
British_Museum-25|The people who built the first part of stonehenge. 
British_Museum-26|With stones moved 250 kilometers from wales. 
British_Museum-27|Were followed by bronze age farmers. 
British_Museum-28|Traders. 
British_Museum-29|And warriors. 
British_Museum-30|Who were connected to continental europe. 
British_Museum-31|At first. 
British_Museum-32|Stonehenge was a cemetery. 
British_Museum-33|It holds the burned remains of up to 200 men women and children. 
British_Museum-34|Wilkins said. 
British_Museum-35|People often ask. 
British_Museum-36|Is it like the pyramids. 
British_Museum-37|But there's no pharaoh in the middle of this monument. 
British_Museum-38|Later the first bluestones were placed in a ring of 4 m tall standing stones. 
British_Museum-39|With lentils across their tops. 
British_Museum-40|Much of that structure still stands. 
British_Museum-41|Wilken said the monument became a place for honoring ancestors. 
British_Museum-42|And for ceremonies. 
British_Museum-43|One of the very first objects visitors to the show see. 
British_Museum-44|Is an ancient cup. 
British_Museum-45|Shaped to look like stonehenge. 
British_Museum-46|It's almost like a prehistoric souvenir. 
British_Museum-47|Said project curator jennifer wexler. 
British_Museum-48|There are many other interesting images in the exhibition from a wall covered in neolithic stone cutting tools. 
British_Museum-49|To finally made hats. 
British_Museum-50|And jewelry. 
British_Museum-51|Stonehenge was not the only circular henge monument built in ancient britain. 
British_Museum-52|The british museum show also look. 
British_Museum-53|At seahenge. 
British_Museum-54|A circle of wood post. 
British_Museum-55|Put up. 
British_Museum-56|4000 years ago. 
British_Museum-57|The structure was uncovered by the waves. 
British_Museum-58|An english beach in 1998. 
British_Museum-59|Like stonehenge it is believed to has been lined up with the sun. 
British_Museum-60|Which was central to the lives and beliefs of these ancient people. 
British_Museum-61|Experts say stonehenge is lined up with sunrise and sunset respectively. 
British_Museum-62|At the summer and winter solstices. 
British_Museum-63|Those are the days with the most and the least daylight of the year. 
British_Museum-64|The shows starring piece. 
British_Museum-65|Is a 3600 year-old nebra sky.. 
British_Museum-66|A bronze circle with gold signs representing the sun moon and stars. 
British_Museum-67|It is believed to be the oldest surviving map of the sky. 
British_Museum-68|The disc was found in 1999 in eastern germany. 
British_Museum-69|But the gold comes from cornwall. 
British_Museum-70|In southwest england. 
British_Museum-71|There is a really a large amount of mobility and migration at this time wilken said. 
British_Museum-72|In time that mobility pushed out the stone age culture that built stonehenge. 
British_Museum-73|Metalworking immigrants from europe brought social and technological change. 
British_Museum-74|Metalman people could carry important symbols with them. 
British_Museum-75|Lessening the need for stone monuments like stonehenge. 
British_Museum-76|Wilken said the show aims to demonstrate. 
British_Museum-77|The human side of the change from the neolithic era to the bronze age. 
British_Museum-78|We've known about that as a technological change he said. 
British_Museum-79|But what we've been able to do in the show i think. 
British_Museum-80|Is to show that it had a big impact on people's beliefs. 
British_Museum-81|And how they saw their identities. 
British_Museum-82|And katy weaver.

Buck_Enters_Church_at_Start_of_Hunting_Season-26|the buck did not appear to have any gunshot wounds

COVID_19_Behind-1|Scientists are investigating a possible increase in diabetes cases since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. 
COVID_19_Behind-2|Diabetes is a condition in which the body cannot control sugar is in the blood. 
COVID_19_Behind-3|The scientists want to find out if covid-19 has a connection with the increase. 
COVID_19_Behind-4|Or if it is a coincidence. 
COVID_19_Behind-5|A report from the centers for disease control and prevention recently examined two large us insurance databases. 
COVID_19_Behind-6|The databases included information about new diabetes cases. 
COVID_19_Behind-7|From march 2020. 
COVID_19_Behind-8|True june 2021. 
COVID_19_Behind-9|The study found that diabetes was more common in children who had had covid-19. 
COVID_19_Behind-10|The report did not look at the difference between type 1 diabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-11|Which usually starts in childhood. 
COVID_19_Behind-12|And type 2. 
COVID_19_Behind-13|The kind tied to being overweight. 
COVID_19_Behind-14|Rates of both kinds of diabetes have risen in u.s. children in recent years. 
COVID_19_Behind-15|But reports from europe and some us hospitals suggest the rates may have increased more during the pandemic. 
COVID_19_Behind-16|Dr. ennis thomas of the university of michigan's cs mott children's hospital said. 
COVID_19_Behind-17|I think we're all a little worried. 
COVID_19_Behind-18|Our hospital has seen a 30% increase in type 1 diabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-19|Compared with the years before the pandemic. 
COVID_19_Behind-20|Thomas said. 
COVID_19_Behind-21|It is not known how many of the cases had covid-19 at some point. 
COVID_19_Behind-22|But the timing raises concerns that there could be a connection. 
COVID_19_Behind-23|She said. 
COVID_19_Behind-24|Type 1 diabetes develops when the pancreas. 
COVID_19_Behind-25|An organ near the kidneys. 
COVID_19_Behind-26|Produces little or no insulin. 
COVID_19_Behind-27|A hormone that controls blood sugar. 
COVID_19_Behind-28|It is thought to involve an autoimmune reaction. 
COVID_19_Behind-29|That means the body's defense system attacks insulin making cells in the pancreas. 
COVID_19_Behind-30|Patients must use manufactured insulin to deal with the condition. 
COVID_19_Behind-31|Experts have believed for a long time that some earlier infection may set off that autoimmune reaction. 
COVID_19_Behind-32|With covid-19. 
COVID_19_Behind-33|We don't know if it's a direct effect. 
COVID_19_Behind-34|Or some other factor that's not fully understood yet. 
COVID_19_Behind-35|But we are hoping that this trend may help us figure out the trigger for what causes type 1 diabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-36|Thomas said. 
COVID_19_Behind-37|At rady children's hospital in san diego. 
COVID_19_Behind-38|Type 1 diabetes cases jumped almost 60% during the first year of the pandemic. 
COVID_19_Behind-39|Compared with the previous 12 months. 
COVID_19_Behind-40|Researchers recently reported the finding in the medical publication gemma pediatrics. 
COVID_19_Behind-41|Just 2% of those children had had active covid-19. 
COVID_19_Behind-42|The report did not have information on any previous infections. 
COVID_19_Behind-43|But the sharp increase was striking. 
COVID_19_Behind-44|And clearly there's a lot more work to be done to try to answer why is this happening. 
COVID_19_Behind-45|Said dr. gene kim. 
COVID_19_Behind-46|Chico wrote the report. 
COVID_19_Behind-47|Type 2 diabetes mostly effects adults. 
COVID_19_Behind-48|It changes how the body uses insulin. 
COVID_19_Behind-49|Meeting to poorly controlled blood sugar. 
COVID_19_Behind-50|Causes are uncertain. 
COVID_19_Behind-51|But genetics. 
COVID_19_Behind-52|Too much weight. 
COVID_19_Behind-53|Inactivity and unhealthy eating habits. 
COVID_19_Behind-54|Play apart. 
COVID_19_Behind-55|It can sometimes be treated or cured with lifestyle changes. 
COVID_19_Behind-56|Around the world more than 540 million people have diabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-57|Including about 37 million in the united states. 
COVID_19_Behind-58|Most have type 2 diabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-59|Many more have higher than normal blood sugar levels. 
COVID_19_Behind-60|Or prediabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-61|Rising diabetes cases might reflect conditions involving pandemic restrictions. 
COVID_19_Behind-62|These could include delayed medical care for early signs of diabetes or unhealthy eating habits and inactivity in people already at risk for type 2 diabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-63|A diabetes center at chicago's la rabida children's hospital has seen an increase in prediabetes during the pandemic. 
COVID_19_Behind-64|Center co-director rosemary briars. 
COVID_19_Behind-65|Suspects long hours of online learning without physical activity played a part. 
COVID_19_Behind-66|Dr. raza kozlowski is a diabetes specialist at chicago's rush university medical center. 
COVID_19_Behind-67|She said steroid drugs that are sometimes used to reduce inflammation in hospitalized patients with infections including covid-19. 
COVID_19_Behind-68|Can cause blood sugar increases leading to diabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-69|Sometimes the condition goes away after steroids are stopped. 
COVID_19_Behind-70|But not always she said. 
COVID_19_Behind-71|The physical stress have severe covid-19 and other illnesses. 
COVID_19_Behind-72|Can also cause high blood sugar and temporary diabetes she added. 
COVID_19_Behind-73|Developing evidence suggests that the coronavirus like some other viruses. 
COVID_19_Behind-74|Can attack insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. 
COVID_19_Behind-75|That process might cause at least temporary diabetes in some people. 
COVID_19_Behind-76|To learn more scientists in denmark are getting adults recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes to take part in a study. 
COVID_19_Behind-77|The study group includes some people who had covid-19. 
COVID_19_Behind-78|Overtime the researchers try to find out whether the condition progresses faster in those who had covid-19. 
COVID_19_Behind-79|Such a study could help show how or if the infection might affect the development of diabetes. 
COVID_19_Behind-80|Said researcher dr. morten andersen. 
COVID_19_Behind-81|He is a diabetes specialist at the hospital of southwest youthland. 
COVID_19_Behind-82|The theory is if you had covid-19 then your own insulin production will be more compromised then if you weren't infected. 
COVID_19_Behind-83|Paragard anderson said. 
COVID_19_Behind-84|I'm john russell. 
COVID_19_Infections-1|Most children who get covid-19 show few to know usual signs of sickness. 
COVID_19_Infections-2|Eight-year-old brooklyn child's of washington d.c.. 
COVID_19_Infections-3|Is one such child. 
COVID_19_Infections-4|The young girl has tested positive. 
COVID_19_Infections-5|For the virus three times. 
COVID_19_Infections-6|She is fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. 
COVID_19_Infections-7|She has never shown serious signs of the disease. 
COVID_19_Infections-8|Today. 
COVID_19_Infections-9|Doctors are trying to understand why she keeps getting infected. 
COVID_19_Infections-10|One time when she caught the virus her father also got sick. 
COVID_19_Infections-11|He later died. 
COVID_19_Infections-12|Her mother danielle is worried that brooklyn could also get very sick. 
COVID_19_Infections-13|The next time she catches the virus. 
COVID_19_Infections-14|Charles said she wonders if her daughter is going to die 2. 
COVID_19_Infections-15|Is this the moment where i lose everyone she asked. 
COVID_19_Infections-16|The covid-19 pandemic started in late. 
COVID_19_Infections-17|2019. 
COVID_19_Infections-18|It is linked to more than. 
COVID_19_Infections-19|6 million deaths around the world. 
COVID_19_Infections-20|But its effects on children are not well-known. 
COVID_19_Infections-21|Over 12 million children in the us are estimated to have tested positive for the virus. 
COVID_19_Infections-22|However the virus does not seem to be as dangerous for children. 
COVID_19_Infections-23|As it is for older adults. 
COVID_19_Infections-24|Some people call what happens to children bizarre. 
COVID_19_Infections-25|Some children suffer from what is known as long covid. 
COVID_19_Infections-26|Others get reinfected like brooklyn. 
COVID_19_Infections-27|Some even seem to get sick. 
COVID_19_Infections-28|And then recover. 
COVID_19_Infections-29|Only to have severe organ inflammation later on. 
COVID_19_Infections-30|Children's national hospital in washington dc. 
COVID_19_Infections-31|Brooklyn and other children are subjects of a study. 
COVID_19_Infections-32|Doctors at the hospital are getting money from the national institutes of health to study the long-term effects of covid-19 on children. 
COVID_19_Infections-33|The hospital has about 200 children up to age 21 in the study. 
COVID_19_Infections-34|Which will go on for 3 years. 
COVID_19_Infections-35|They undergo many tasks. 
COVID_19_Infections-36|On their first visit to the hospital. 
COVID_19_Infections-37|Doctors take blood listen to their heart and check their lungs. 
COVID_19_Infections-38|Roberta dibiase. 
COVID_19_Infections-39|Is the doctor leading the study. 
COVID_19_Infections-40|She said the researchers are trying to understand the problems children suffer after getting covid. 
COVID_19_Infections-41|And how common they are. 
COVID_19_Infections-42|Another girl in the study is alyssa carpenter. 
COVID_19_Infections-43|She is 3 years old. 
COVID_19_Infections-44|She had covid-19 two times. 
COVID_19_Infections-45|And also has unusual symptoms. 
COVID_19_Infections-46|Such as high fevers and foot pain. 
COVID_19_Infections-47|Sometimes she lies down and points to her chest and says. 
COVID_19_Infections-48|She has pain there too. 
COVID_19_Infections-49|Alyssa's parents tara and tyson carpenter. 
COVID_19_Infections-50|Have two other daughters. 
COVID_19_Infections-51|They said the pandemic caused a lot of problems in their lives. 
COVID_19_Infections-52|But they are most worried about alyssa. 
COVID_19_Infections-53|Whom they do not know how to help. 
COVID_19_Infections-54|Tara carpenter called the situation. 
COVID_19_Infections-55|Super frustrating. 
COVID_19_Infections-56|She said she has been looking for answers to her daughter's problems. 
COVID_19_Infections-57|But no one is able to provide them. 
COVID_19_Infections-58|Some days the little girl is doing just fine. 
COVID_19_Infections-59|Others days. 
COVID_19_Infections-60|She has a fever or pain. 
COVID_19_Infections-61|But lately the family says she is doing a little better. 
COVID_19_Infections-62|One doctor working on the study. 
COVID_19_Infections-63|Is linda herbert. 
COVID_19_Infections-64|She does a psychological test. 
COVID_19_Infections-65|She talks to the children about things like the quality of their sleep. 
COVID_19_Infections-66|The worries they have. 
COVID_19_Infections-67|How they get along with other children and. 
COVID_19_Infections-68|Whether they have trouble remembering things. 
COVID_19_Infections-69|She said there are many symptoms. 
COVID_19_Infections-70|Adding that many children. 
COVID_19_Infections-71|Are worried about getting sick again. 
COVID_19_Infections-72|Herbert said psychological symptoms are just as common as physical symptoms like pain. 
COVID_19_Infections-73|And it is not just the children who have a lot of worries. 
COVID_19_Infections-74|The parents. 
COVID_19_Infections-75|Brothers and sisters of the children. 
COVID_19_Infections-76|Have stress and anxiety too. 
COVID_19_Infections-77|Brooklyn's mother danielle is working hard. 
COVID_19_Infections-78|To keep her emotions from affecting her daughter. 
COVID_19_Infections-79|She is working to support. 
COVID_19_Infections-80|Her family now that her husband died. 
COVID_19_Infections-81|She also is dealing with her sadness and trying not to show her feelings to her daughter. 
COVID_19_Infections-82|She wanted to put brooklyn in the studies so more people would learn about the need for vaccines. 
COVID_19_Infections-83|Especially among black people. 
COVID_19_Infections-84|Her husband rodney was not vaccinated. 
COVID_19_Infections-85|He suffered from pre-existing conditions and. 
COVID_19_Infections-86|Died at the age of 42. 
COVID_19_Infections-87|Child said one of the last things her husband said before he died was. 
COVID_19_Infections-88|Forgive me. 
COVID_19_Infections-89|She said it is true that many children are not getting sick if they catch the virus. 
COVID_19_Infections-90|However. 
COVID_19_Infections-91|They are losing she said. 
COVID_19_Infections-92|They're losing parents. 
COVID_19_Infections-93|Social lives. 
COVID_19_Infections-94|Years. 
COVID_19_Infections-95|Child said. 
COVID_19_Infections-96|Yes. 
COVID_19_Infections-97|Kids are resilient. 
COVID_19_Infections-98|But they can't go on like this. 
COVID_19_Infections-99|No one is this resilient. 
COVID_19_Infections-100|I'm dan friedel. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-1|Researchers around the world. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-2|Are trying to find out. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-3|How much and where. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-4|Covid-19 is spreading in the wild. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-5|For researcher todd kautz and his team. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-6|That means giving covid tests to animals like bears. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-7|Moose. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-8|Deer and wolves. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-9|They are doing their research on a native american reservation. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-10|In the northwoods of grand portage minnesota. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-11|Close to canada. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-12|Scientists are concerned that the virus could change within animal populations. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-13|That could possibly create dangerous new viral mutations. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-14|That could jump back to humans and spread among people. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-15|The pandemic has shown that the health of humans and animals is closely related. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-16|Exactly how the virus started has never been proven. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-17|But many scientists say it likely jumped from bats to humans. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-18|It could also have jumped to humans directly. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-19|Or through another animal that was being sold live. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-20|In wuhan china. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-21|Now the virus has been confirmed in wildlife in 24 states in the united states. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-22|Including minnesota. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-23|Recently. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-24|A canadian study showed someone in nearby ontario. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-25|Blakely got a highly mutated form of the virus from a deer. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-26|If the virus can establish itself in a wild animal reservoir. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-27|It will always be out there with the threats to spill back into the human population. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-28|Said matthew aliotta. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-29|He is a researcher with the university of minnesota. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-30|Working with the grand portage reservation team. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-31|Ej isaac is a fish and wildlife scientist. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-32|He said the risk of the virus mutating grows with the start of spring. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-33|When bears wake from hibernation. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-34|And deer and wolves move to different areas. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-35|He said more movement among animals. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-36|Increases the chance of transmission. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-37|The team's research carries its own set of risks. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-38|Sometimes they must capture animals from the air. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-39|Using a helicopter. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-40|They target animals like deer and moose from the air with a net gun. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-41|Researchers then test the animals nose for covid. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-42|And put a tracking device on it. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-43|Another time kouts had to enter a bear's den while it was hibernating. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-44|In order to test it. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-45|After testing the bear cavs sent the samples to a lab. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-46|He hopes to learn not just which animals are getting infected. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-47|But also whether certain animals. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-48|Are more likely to spread the virus to other species. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-49|Close contact between humans and animals. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-50|Has permitted the virus to defeat barriers to spread between species. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-51|To infect any living thing. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-52|The virus must get into its cells. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-53|Which is not always easy. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-54|Virus expert david o'connor. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-55|Compares the process to opening a lock. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-56|With the viruses spike protein key. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-57|Different species have different looking locks. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-58|And some of those locks are not going to be open a bowl by the key. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-59|The university of wisconsin-madison scientists said. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-60|What other locks are similar enough for the virus to enter and animal cells. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-61|And make copies of itself. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-62|As it does. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-63|It can mutate. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-64|And still have a key that fits into the human lock. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-65|That permits it to go back to humans through close contact with live animals. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-66|Scientist believe. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-67|It is rare for a virus to spread from animals to humans. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-68|But it only takes one person to bring a mutated virus to the world of humans. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-69|Some scientists think the omicron variants of the coronavirus. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-70|Came from an animal rather than a human. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-71|What scientists are mostly concerned about. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-72|Is variance spreading widely within a species that comes in contact with humans. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-73|Like deer. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-74|Scientists found the coronavirus in a third of deer. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-75|Tested in iowa between september 2020. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-76|And january 2021. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-77|Other studies found virus antibodies in a third of deer tested in illinois. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-78|Michigan new york and pennsylvania. 
COVID_Fight_Moves-79|Andrea novak. 
California-1|The university of california system will continue not to require. 
California-2|Widely used tests to decide which students it will accept. 
California-3|The nine university of california schools that accept. 
California-4|Undergraduates. 
California-5|Will not use the sat and act standardized tests. 
California-6|And has no plans to require them in the future. 
California-7|A standardized test is an examination. 
California-8|That is given to a large number of people. 
California-9|To compare their abilities. 
California-10|There are over 200,000 undergraduate students within the university of california system. 
California-11|An undergraduate is a student. 
California-12|Who is working toward their first college degree. 
California-13|The well-known schools in the system. 
California-14|Include the university of california berkeley. 
California-15|The university of california los angeles. 
California-16|Ucla. 
California-17|And the university of california santa barbara. 
California-18|The university of california system is run by a board of regents. 
California-19|Most are appointed by the state's governor. 
California-20|In mid-november the board of regents said it was not able to find a good replacement. 
California-21|For the sat or act tests. 
California-22|The group sad. 
California-23|There would not be a new test anytime soon. 
California-24|Standardized tests have become a subject of debate. 
California-25|And legal action in recent years. 
California-26|Part of the dispute has been caused by the covid-19 pandemic. 
California-27|Many universities decided. 
California-28|It would be up to students if they wanted to send test scores. 
California-29|With their applications. 
California-30|They are known as test optional schools. 
California-31|Meaning the test scores. 
California-32|Are not required. 
California-33|One of the most well-known schools in this group is the university of chicago. 
California-34|In the last 2 years. 
California-35|Colleges and universities reported getting more applications. 
California-36|From students in general. 
California-37|They have especially received more applications from the minority groups. 
California-38|Critics say. 
California-39|The traditional standardized tests. 
California-40|Do not predict how well students will do in college. 
California-41|In addition. 
California-42|They say some businesses created. 
California-43|Costly test preparation classes. 
California-44|That not every student can pay for. 
California-45|As a result. 
California-46|They say rich students. 
California-47|Especially those who are white or asian. 
California-48|Are in a better position. 
California-49|Supporters of the tests say they help some students. 
California-50|Who have trouble getting good grades in high school. 
California-51|Show that they can be good college students. 
California-52|The worry. 
California-53|That removing the test. 
California-54|Could keep those students from going to good colleges. 
California-55|2 years ago. 
California-56|A group that included the compton unified school district in california. 
California-57|Brought legal action against the university of california system. 
California-58|If called for the universities to remove the test requirement. 
California-59|Compton has many black and hispanic students. 
California-60|Who do not apply to competitive colleges. 
California-61|In may 2021. 
California-62|The university reached an agreement with the groups that brought the case. 
California-63|It's sad. 
California-64|It would stop using the sat and act for the four years. 
California-65|Ending in 2025. 
California-66|It also agreed to pay over $1000000 in legal costs. 
California-67|The university of california then decided to study whether the tests. 
California-68|Permitted the school. 
California-69|To bring in a group of diverse and able students each year. 
California-70|Their study showed that standardized tests. 
California-71|Aid in predicting student performance. 
California-72|Including their grades. 
California-73|However. 
California-74|The university decided to change its test policies anyway. 
California-75|Over the last year the study group considered using a test. 
California-76|That is given to 11th grade students in california public schools. 
California-77|Called smarter balanced. 
California-78|The idea was to replace the sat and act. 
California-79|Marygrove on a professor at the university of california riverside. 
California-80|Was one of the group leaders. 
California-81|At the recent meeting. 
California-82|She said. 
California-83|The new test would provide. 
California-84|Only modest value. 
California-85|Beyond high school grades in predicting how a student would perform in college. 
California-86|In addition. 
California-87|She said the professors in the study group worried that adding. 
California-88|High stakes to the smarter balanced test. 
California-89|Would lead to companies creating new costly test preparation classes. 
California-90|Michael brown. 
California-91|Is the leader of the university of california system called the provost. 
California-92|He announced the final decision. 
California-93|You see will continue to practice test free admission. 
California-94|Now and into the future. 
California-95|With the major universities in california permanently removing the standardized tests. 
California-96|What other universities do the same. 
California-97|Jeremy bauer wolf. 
California-98|Is a reporter for higher-ed dive. 
California-99|A website that covers higher education in the us. 
California-100|He said. 
California-101|He thinks they will. 
California-102|Higher education. 
California-103|Is very much a case of follow the leader he said. 
California-104|Colleges don't necessarily always want to act. 
California-105|Unless they see their peers doing the same thing. 
California-106|The uc system publicly doing away with these tests. 
California-107|Will reverberate. 
California-108|Especially through. 
California-109|California but you know other other institutions that might be looked at as competitive. 
California-110|Powerwolf said universities throughout the us have been evaluating test-optional admissions. 
California-111|During the pandemic. 
California-112|However. 
California-113|He thinks those policies may soon become permanent. 
California-114|Test optional he notes is different from removing test. 
California-115|From a student's application. 
California-116|A study released earlier this year. 
California-117|Looked a test-optional admissions starting in 2005. 
California-118|It found schools that made the change. 
California-119|Did see an increase. 
California-120|In first-time minority and women students. 
California-121|Once more schools follow california and drop the test requirements. 
California-122|Fewer students will take the tests. 
California-123|That will hurt the companies that produce the tests. 
California-124|Powerwolf sad. 
California-125|That's something to closely watch. 
California-126|He said. 
California-127|I'm dan friedel.

California_Permitting-26|It makes up about 1% of the nation's farmland but produces 25% of the nation's food. 
California_Permitting-27|More than 250 crops grow in the area. 
California_Permitting-28|It also is home to about one-fifth of all groundwater pumping in the us. 
California_Permitting-29|A flood in the 1860s demonstrates the possibility for disaster. 
California_Permitting-30|But the state's population and farm production quickly grew through the 20th century. 
California_Permitting-31|The government built huge new water redirection systems. 
California_Permitting-32|The water supplies supported people and farms. 
California_Permitting-33|And the dams protected cities and crops. 
California_Permitting-34|The dam's generally cutoff rivers from their natural floodplains. 
California_Permitting-35|As climate change causes temperatures to warm. 
California_Permitting-36|Mountain snow can fill rivers much faster. 
California_Permitting-37|Increasing the flows so much that dams fail. 
California_Permitting-38|Floodplain recreation can help. 
California_Permitting-39|For projects like dos rios. 
California_Permitting-40|Land that farmers no longer want to use. 
California_Permitting-41|Is being turned into space where rivers can overflow. 
California_Permitting-42|California officials began centralizing valley flood planning 10 years ago. 
California_Permitting-43|In 1997 major storms caused flood barriers to break throughout the valley. 
California_Permitting-44|Including on the tuolumne river. 
California_Permitting-45|Nine people were killed and more than 20,000 homes were destroyed. 
California_Permitting-46|Total damage cost in the area reached 2 billion dollars. 
California_Permitting-47|Officials have updated the central valley flood protection plan. 
California_Permitting-48|It details ways to lower flood risk. 
California_Permitting-49|And protect. 
California_Permitting-50|The 1.3 million people who live on floodplains. 
California_Permitting-51|Dos rios is one of 17 floodplain projects identified by the state. 
California_Permitting-52|Has been completed since 2013. 
California_Permitting-53|Three projects are active. 
California_Permitting-54|And 10 more are proposed. 
California_Permitting-55|They have cost 300 million dollars so far. 
California_Permitting-56|Money has come from local and federal resources. 
California_Permitting-57|Dos rios is an amazing example. 
California_Permitting-58|But we need like 30 more of those. 
California_Permitting-59|Said jane dolan. 
California_Permitting-60|She is chair of the central valley flood protection board. 
California_Permitting-61|Similar projects are taking place around the country. 
California_Permitting-62|The biden administration has proposed at least 1.75 billion dollars. 
California_Permitting-63|In an infrastructure bill. 
California_Permitting-64|For projects aimed at reducing flood risk. 
California_Permitting-65|Just as climate change is making california's dry periods dryer. 
California_Permitting-66|It is also expected to make the wet periods wetter. 
California_Permitting-67|The state experienced major rain and snowfall in december. 
California_Permitting-68|Then it experienced its driest january through march on record. 
California_Permitting-69|One of the things that drives me crazy about california water is that decision-makers wants to talk about floods in flood years. 
California_Permitting-70|And droughts in drought hears sudbury nelson. 
California_Permitting-71|He is a water control expert who worked on the dos rios project. 
California_Permitting-72|Since the 1850s 95%. 
California_Permitting-73|Of the historical wetlands and river habitats in the central valley have been destroyed. 
California_Permitting-74|The property jose rios sits on was most recently a dairy. 
California_Permitting-75|Its owners began discussing a possible sale to river partners for conservation in the mid-2000s. 
California_Permitting-76|River partners has planted 14 kinds of woody trees and other plants designed to appeal to native species. 
California_Permitting-77|The group said the habitat supports the aleutian cackling goose. 
California_Permitting-78|Which used to be listed as an endangered species. 
California_Permitting-79|Dos rios is also home to the riparian brush rabbit. 
California_Permitting-80|Chinook salmon. 
California_Permitting-81|Steelhead trout. 
California_Permitting-82|The yellow warbler and the sandhill crane. 
California_Permitting-83|Supporters that such projects would like to see them build faster in california and beyond. 
California_Permitting-84|Rentner of river partners. 
California_Permitting-85|Said there is general agreement on the value of recreating floodplains. 
California_Permitting-86|But there are also debates over costs and other issues that can slow work down. 
California_Permitting-87|She noted. 
California_Permitting-88|In the complex world of california water. 
California_Permitting-89|Floodplain recreation stands out. 
California_Permitting-90|Expert barry nelson said. 
California_Permitting-91|In this sort of ocean of disagreements about water policy about all these other issues he said. 
California_Permitting-92|Flood control policy has seen broad support. 
California_Permitting-93|I'm katy weaver. 
California_Permitting-94|And i'm ashley thompson. 
Campus-1|Schools in uganda have been fully or partly closed for more than 77 weeks. 
Campus-2|Because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Campus-3|The united nations cultural agency says that is the longest break anywhere in the world. 
Campus-4|Many countries around the world moved their school lessons to the internet. 
Campus-5|But no schools in the east african country. 
Campus-6|We're unable to offer virtual schooling. 
Campus-7|Without school. 
Campus-8|Some ugandan students got married. 
Campus-9|Some are dealing with unwanted pregnancies. 
Campus-10|Others have found jobs. 
Campus-11|Efforts to control the spread of covid-19. 
Campus-12|Have upset the lives of children around the world. 
Campus-13|It has caused difficulties for parents. 
Campus-14|It has also removed many safeguards. 
Campus-15|The aid group save the children. 
Campus-16|Said the pandemic has led to the biggest global education emergency of our time. 
Campus-17|The group identified 48 countries. 
Campus-18|Including uganda. 
Campus-19|Whose school systems are at extreme or high risk of collapse. 
Campus-20|Most are in sub-saharan africa. 
Campus-21|This part of the world has long struggled with high dropout rates. 
Campus-22|Among students. 
Campus-23|And a shortage of well-trained teachers. 
Campus-24|Summer other countries that's all closures also struggled to teach children. 
Campus-25|Mexico has low internet connectivity in many places. 
Campus-26|It shows to use educational programming by television. 
Campus-27|The pandemic has been disastrous for children in mexico. 
Campus-28|It has led to millions leaving school as well as increases in child murder. 
Campus-29|Teen pregnancy. 
Campus-30|And violence and holmes. 
Campus-31|Any rock virtual learning is limited and unequal the world bank has reported. 
Campus-32|Some wealthier countries did better. 
Campus-33|Public schools in kuwait did not have what they needed to go virtual when the pandemic first struck. 
Campus-34|All schooling was suspended for 7 months. 
Campus-35|But the oil-rich gulf arab states. 
Campus-36|Find 212 million dollars to create virtual school programming. 
Campus-37|The costly effort has been considered a success. 
Campus-38|Uganda first closed its schools and march of 2020. 
Campus-39|Shortly after the first coronavirus case was confirmed on the african continent. 
Campus-40|Some classes were reopened two students almost one year later in february. 
Campus-41|But a total closure happened again in june. 
Campus-42|As the country faced its first major increase of coronavirus cases. 
Campus-43|Today. 
Campus-44|Uganda is the only country in africa where schools remain closed. 
Campus-45|President yoweri museveni announced last week that schools would reopen in january. 
Campus-46|His announcement comes as the country has seen a decrease in virus cases in recent months. 
Campus-47|Experts at johns hopkins university. 
Campus-48|Say the country is now recording an average of 70 new infections each day. 
Campus-49|So far. 
Campus-50|Uganda has fully vaccinated about 700,000 of its 44 million people. 
Campus-51|First lady janet museveni is the country's education minister. 
Campus-52|She has rejected criticism that the country is not doing enough to teach its children. 
Campus-53|Anna speech in october she asked. 
Campus-54|Why are children cannot be safe at home. 
Campus-55|What happened to the family. 
Campus-56|Some ugandan say the problem is that the government has not found a successful way to keep up learning during lockdown.. 
Campus-57|One suggested solution was to broadcast lessons through free radio set. 
Campus-58|But that plan did not happen. 
Campus-59|And rule areas. 
Campus-60|Many children do not have learning materials of any kind. 
Campus-61|In the ugandan town of basa. 
Campus-62|It was common to see children selling goods and a streets even before the pandemic hit. 
Campus-63|Things have only gotten worse. 
Campus-64|The associated press recently spoke with some children there. 
Campus-65|Many of them expressed hopelessness during the long lockdown. 
Campus-66|Mercedes aquaco is one of those children. 
Campus-67|He searches for gold with other children to pass the time. 
Campus-68|He wears his school clothing while searching for the valuable metal. 
Campus-69|Because he has nothing else to wear. 
Campus-70|He regrets that he must work. 
Campus-71|The tiring days leave him little energy to study on his own. 
Campus-72|No time for reading books he said. 
Campus-73|If you try to open a book. 
Campus-74|You just go asleep and sleep up to tomorrow. 
Campus-75|Children work alongside adults at the unofficial goldmine. 
Campus-76|Some of the adults are their teachers. 
Campus-77|Observers say the risks and feelings of doing dangerous work have led to fight. 
Campus-78|Some children have broken bones while digging. 
Campus-79|A usual day can bring in just over $2. 
Campus-80|Enough for a child to buy a used pair of shoes. 
Campus-81|Add acuaticos marrero school. 
Campus-82|Teacher meo dillow said he expects a small number of the 400 students to return next year. 
Campus-83|Bosco masaba is the director of studies at busch's central primary school.

Campus-85|He heard that some girls become house workers for families across the border in kenya. 
Campus-86|Masa barsad. 
Campus-87|Some they have lost hope completely. 
Campus-88|I'm gregory stoeckel. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-1|Joyce aries was feeling fine when she agreed to get a blood test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-2|For research. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-3|So she was surprised. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-4|When the tests came back with signs of cancer. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-5|After a repeat blood test and two more tests for cancer. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-6|She was found to have hodgkin lymphoma. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-7|I cried. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-8|The 74-year old retiree set. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-9|Just a couple of tears and thought. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-10|Okay. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-11|Now what do we do. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-12|Aries had volunteered to take a blood test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-13|That is being viewed as a new way to check for cancer among healthy people. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-14|It looks for cancer by checking for dna parts broken. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-15|From shed cancerous cells. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-16|Search blood test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-17|Cold liquid biopsies. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-18|Are already used in patients with cancer. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-19|To establish treatment. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-20|And check to see if cancerous growth. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-21|Comeback. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-22|Several drug companies are pushing for the blood test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-23|As part of regular health screening to find cancerous growth or tumors. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-24|In certain parts of the body. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-25|Grill a california-based company is far ahead of others. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-26|With 2,000 doctors. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-27|Willing to prescribe. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-28|The 949 dollar test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-29|Most insurance plans do not cover the cost. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-30|The food and drug administration demands and extensive study of a drug or vaccine. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-31|Before approval. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-32|A review by the agency. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-33|Is not required for this kind of blood test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-34|But grill plans to seek approval from the fda. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-35|Well it is marketing the test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-36|Experts are not sure whether the test could improve americans health. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-37|Or help cut the cancer death rate. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-38|Us government researchers meanwhile. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-39|Are planning a large trial. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-40|With 200,000 volunteers. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-41|Over 7 years. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-42|To study the blood test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-43|They sound wonderful but we don't have enough information. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-44|Set dr. lori minasian. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-45|Of the national cancer institute. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-46|She is involved in planning the research. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-47|We don't have definitive data that shows that they will reduce the risk of dying from cancer. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-48|The history of cancer screening has served as a warning. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-49|In 2004. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-50|Japan halted mass screening of infants. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-51|For childhood cancer. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-52|After studies found it did not save lives. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-53|Last year. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-54|A 16-year study. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-55|Of 200,000 women in britain. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-56|Found regular screening for ovarian cancer. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-57|Did not make any difference in deaths. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-58|Cases like these have uncovered some surprises. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-59|Screening finds some cancers that do not need treatment. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-60|On the other side mini tumors spread so fast that they prove to be deadly anyway. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-61|Cancer screening at times. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-62|Can do more harm than good. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-63|It leads to worry over false positives. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-64|Unnecessary costs. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-65|And. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-66|Serious side effects from cancer care. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-67|Dr. joshua ofman isn't official with grail. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-68|He said current screening test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-69|Only look for one kind of cancer at a time. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-70|Including breast. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-71|Cervix colon or lung. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-72|The new blood test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-73|Look for many cancers at once. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-74|We scream for four or five cancers in this country. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-75|But many cancer deaths are coming from cancers. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-76|That we're not looking for at all. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-77|Huffman said. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-78|Dr. thomas beer of oregon health and science university in portland. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-79|Let the grill study that joyce aries joined in 2020. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-80|After chemotherapy and radiation. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-81|Doctors told her the treatment was a success. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-82|Beer said aries his case is a hoped-for ideal outcome. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-83|He added. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-84|Not everyone is going to have that. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-85|For some beer said the blood test could bring false positives. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-86|For others the test found cancer that turned out to be advanced and aggressive. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-87|Grill continues to update its test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-88|As it learns from these studies. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-89|The company is also working with britain's national health service. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-90|Understudy of 140,000 people. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-91|They want to see if the blood test can reduce the number of advanced cancers. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-92|Although aries feels lucky. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-93|It is impossible to know. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-94|Whether her test added healthy years to her life. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-95|Or made no real difference. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-96|Said cramer. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-97|Former director of the national cancer institute's division of cancer prevention. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-98|I sincerely hope that joyce benefited from having this test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-99|Cramer said when told of her experience. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-100|But unfortunately. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-101|We can't know. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-102|At the individual joyce level. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-103|Whether that's the case. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-104|Cancer treatments can have long-term side effects he said. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-105|And we don't know how fast the tumor would have grown. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-106|Treatment for hodgkin lymphoma is very effective. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-107|It is possible that joyce would have had the same good results. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-108|If she had sought treatment. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-109|Only after she showed symptoms. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-110|For now health experts say the grail blood test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-111|Is not a cancer diagnosis. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-112|This is a path in diagnostic testing. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-113|That has never been tried before kramer said. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-114|Our ultimate destination is a test. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-115|That has a clear netbenefit. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-116|If we don't do it carefully. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-117|We'll go way off the path. 
Can_Cancer_Blood-118|I'm jill robbins. 
Carnegie_Mellon-1|School districts around the united states. 
Carnegie_Mellon-2|We're not ready for online learning when the coronavirus health crisis hit. 
Carnegie_Mellon-3|And it affected students. 
Carnegie_Mellon-4|Research on test scores over the past year. 
Carnegie_Mellon-5|Suggest that students learning slowed down. 
Carnegie_Mellon-6|A study by the center for reinventing public education. 
Carnegie_Mellon-7|Or crpe. 
Carnegie_Mellon-8|Pointed to school closures. 
Carnegie_Mellon-9|And the switch to remote learning. 
Carnegie_Mellon-10|As likely reasons for the problem. 
Carnegie_Mellon-11|Lawmakers and parents. 
Carnegie_Mellon-12|Have said the return to in-person classes. 
Carnegie_Mellon-13|Is important for the school year. 
Carnegie_Mellon-14|But education experts. 
Carnegie_Mellon-15|Say online classes are here to stay. 
Carnegie_Mellon-16|And that students need to know how to learn online. 
Carnegie_Mellon-17|To be prepared for college. 
Carnegie_Mellon-18|And the workforce. 
Carnegie_Mellon-19|Christine pitts is an education expert. 
Carnegie_Mellon-20|With crpe. 
Carnegie_Mellon-21|She said that it is hard to judge the effectiveness of last year's remote learning. 
Carnegie_Mellon-22|Many school districts had to make a quick change. 
Carnegie_Mellon-23|To remote classes. 
Carnegie_Mellon-24|During the health crisis. 
Carnegie_Mellon-25|And we're not prepared. 
Carnegie_Mellon-26|We know that virtual learning is not going to go away in a post covid world. 
Carnegie_Mellon-27|Pitt said. 
Carnegie_Mellon-28|But we also know that it cannot be the same as emergency learning. 
Carnegie_Mellon-29|Kids said there is little research. 
Carnegie_Mellon-30|On how to structure online classes. 
Carnegie_Mellon-31|She said few education researchers. 
Carnegie_Mellon-32|Have looked at online teaching methods at the kindergarten through 12th grade level. 
Carnegie_Mellon-33|Not having that evidence makes it really hard for systems leaders. 
Carnegie_Mellon-34|For teachers. 
Carnegie_Mellon-35|For superintendent to make those decisions. 
Carnegie_Mellon-36|About how to design remote learning moving forward. 
Carnegie_Mellon-37|Pitt said. 
Carnegie_Mellon-38|Educators do you have some research. 
Carnegie_Mellon-39|About how to structure on my morning. 
Carnegie_Mellon-40|For example research suggests that children learn better when they can physically move around. 
Carnegie_Mellon-41|Online classes could support this kind of behavior. 
Carnegie_Mellon-42|By asking students to take walks. 
Carnegie_Mellon-43|Or do activities away from the computer. 
Carnegie_Mellon-44|Argued katie taylor in the publication the conversation. 
Carnegie_Mellon-45|She is a professor of learning sciences and human development. 
Carnegie_Mellon-46|At the university of washington. 
Carnegie_Mellon-47|Learning the best methods for online teaching. 
Carnegie_Mellon-48|Has taken some time. 
Carnegie_Mellon-49|Said judy perez. 
Carnegie_Mellon-50|She is an educator with 20 years of experience in online education at the kindergarten through 12th grade level. 
Carnegie_Mellon-51|She is also the head of ilearn collaborative in colorado. 
Carnegie_Mellon-52|It is a nonprofit organization that trains teachers in online teaching methods. 
Carnegie_Mellon-53|Colorado passed a law in 2007. 
Carnegie_Mellon-54|That expanded online and hybrid classes in the state. 
Carnegie_Mellon-55|Hybrid classes mix online and in-person instruction. 
Carnegie_Mellon-56|Perez began teaching virtual instruction in 2001. 
Carnegie_Mellon-57|When we didn't know what we were doing. 
Carnegie_Mellon-58|We were just trying to figure out. 
Carnegie_Mellon-59|How do we teach in the space. 
Carnegie_Mellon-60|But over time she and other experts were able to develop training methods. 
Carnegie_Mellon-61|And measure student performance in online classrooms. 
Carnegie_Mellon-62|Last year. 
Carnegie_Mellon-63|Perez said many teachers in the district she worked with before the pandemic. 
Carnegie_Mellon-64|We're surprised. 
Carnegie_Mellon-65|They found they were able to make the change from in person to virtual learning quickly. 
Carnegie_Mellon-66|When the pandemic started. 
Carnegie_Mellon-67|She said however that student learning was affected. 
Carnegie_Mellon-68|By how well-trained a teacher was. 
Carnegie_Mellon-69|In online instruction. 
Carnegie_Mellon-70|I think you would see a difference in student learning. 
Carnegie_Mellon-71|Depending on how well-trained the teachers were. 
Carnegie_Mellon-72|And those that just jumped into this environment. 
Carnegie_Mellon-73|Perez said. 
Carnegie_Mellon-74|Taking a lesson meant for the classroom. 
Carnegie_Mellon-75|And simply moving it online does not work she said. 
Carnegie_Mellon-76|Teachers need to be able to use the online environment. 
Carnegie_Mellon-77|And computer technology. 
Carnegie_Mellon-78|To keep those students interested. 
Carnegie_Mellon-79|They also need to build relationships with their students. 
Carnegie_Mellon-80|Said jill pellegrini. 
Carnegie_Mellon-81|She also trains teachers for ilearn collaborative. 
Carnegie_Mellon-82|What we've been doing with our training. 
Carnegie_Mellon-83|Is really focusing on that student engagement. 
Carnegie_Mellon-84|Pellegrini said. 
Carnegie_Mellon-85|How do you build community. 
Carnegie_Mellon-86|How do you build relationships. 
Carnegie_Mellon-87|Pitts said that kids learning at home. 
Carnegie_Mellon-88|Have made parents more involved. 
Carnegie_Mellon-89|In their child's schooling. 
Carnegie_Mellon-90|It has become easier for parents. 
Carnegie_Mellon-91|To see what their children are learning and how they are progressing. 
Carnegie_Mellon-92|They can ask teachers questions. 
Carnegie_Mellon-93|About what is being learned. 
Carnegie_Mellon-94|It is something that we want to pull forward into whatever remote learning occurs in the future. 
Carnegie_Mellon-95|Pitt said. 
Carnegie_Mellon-96|Perez said that all students should have some experience with online learning. 
Carnegie_Mellon-97|Those that do not will have a harder time when they go to college. 
Carnegie_Mellon-98|Or enter workforce training programs that use online instruction. 
Carnegie_Mellon-99|She said. 
Carnegie_Mellon-100|Perez added. 
Carnegie_Mellon-101|She does not recommend fully online schooling. 
Carnegie_Mellon-102|But she said hybrid classes could be better for students. 
Carnegie_Mellon-103|Needing special consideration. 
Carnegie_Mellon-104|Like athletes. 
Carnegie_Mellon-105|And those with disabilities or health problems. 
Carnegie_Mellon-106|It's noted that there is little research about how to teach virtual classes. 
Carnegie_Mellon-107|What classes are easier or harder to teach online. 
Carnegie_Mellon-108|Or what kinds of students are best for it. 
Carnegie_Mellon-109|It's such an understudied type of teaching she said. 
Carnegie_Mellon-110|I'm dan novak. 
Charging_Putin-1|The shocking images and stories out of butta and surrounding towns in ukraine. 
Charging_Putin-2|Have led to calls for a war crimes trial against russia. 
Charging_Putin-3|Ukraine president volodymyr zelensky. 
Charging_Putin-4|Told to united nations security council on tuesday that it was the most terrible war crime since world war ii. 
Charging_Putin-5|Set the russian military killed civilians just for their pleasures. 
Charging_Putin-6|He accused them of shooting men in the back of their heads and raping and killing women in front of their children. 
Charging_Putin-7|Anyone who has given criminal orders and carried them out by killing our people will be brought before the tribunal which should be similar to the nuremberg tribunal he said. 
Charging_Putin-8|Earlier on monday united states president joe biden. 
Charging_Putin-9|Had also joined leaders around the world in calling for a war crimes trial against russian president vladimir putin. 
Charging_Putin-10|He said putin was a war criminal who should be brought to trial. 
Charging_Putin-11|But experts warn the path to holding the russian president and other leaders criminally responsible is long and complex. 
Charging_Putin-12|Clint williamson served as a us diplomat for war crimes issues from 2006 to 2009. 
Charging_Putin-13|He told the associated press. 
Charging_Putin-14|Certainly the discovery of bodies which bear signs of executions such as gunshot wounds to the head presents strong evidence of war crimes. 
Charging_Putin-15|He added the actions were not permitted for those who had been taken prisoner were civilians or soldiers. 
Charging_Putin-16|Russian officials strongly denied the accusations. 
Charging_Putin-17|It's defense ministry said that not a single civilian has faced any violent action by the russian military. 
Charging_Putin-18|And foreign minister sergei lavrov. 
Charging_Putin-19|Claimed that the images were state used to bring anti-russian feelings. 
Charging_Putin-20|The new york times disproved the russian planes and it's study of satellite images provided by maxar technologies. 
Charging_Putin-21|The times reported that at least eleven bodies of those killed in bucho had been on the street since march 11th. 
Charging_Putin-22|Russian troops did not withdraw from the area until march 30th. 
Charging_Putin-23|The international criminal court. 
Charging_Putin-24|Or icc. 
Charging_Putin-25|Has already opened an investigation in march. 
Charging_Putin-26|Into crimes against civilians in ukraine. 
Charging_Putin-27|The investigation came after russian airstrikes hit a hospital for children and pregnant women in mario pole. 
Charging_Putin-28|To build a case for war crimes prosecutors must gather evidence to establish the cause and facts of the victims deaths. 
Charging_Putin-29|They also need to show that the crime happened in an armed conflict. 
Charging_Putin-30|Which is the case in ukraine. 
Charging_Putin-31|Then comes the more difficult work of establishing who was responsible for the crimes. 
Charging_Putin-32|It could be forces on the ground. 
Charging_Putin-33|Military commanders or government leaders. 
Charging_Putin-34|Andreas schuller is the program director for international crimes and accountability at the european centre for constitutional and human rights in berlin. 
Charging_Putin-35|He said prosecutors need to look into the chain of command and establish a link. 
Charging_Putin-36|To the evidence. 
Charging_Putin-37|Documents could be leaked. 
Charging_Putin-38|Or witnesses could speak up and disclose internal planning operations he added. 
Charging_Putin-39|Building a case against putin and other russian leaders. 
Charging_Putin-40|Will be more difficult. 
Charging_Putin-41|You got to prove that they knew or they could have known or should have known. 
Charging_Putin-42|Set filipe signs. 
Charging_Putin-43|He is a british lawyer and professor at university college london. 
Charging_Putin-44|Award. 
Charging_Putin-45|There was a risk that the trials will involve mid-level people. 
Charging_Putin-46|Without reaching the top leaders. 
Charging_Putin-47|An easier path would be to charge russian leaders for the crime of aggression. 
Charging_Putin-48|Which is the act of launching a war without cause against another country. 
Charging_Putin-49|However the icc has no jurisdiction over russia for the crime of aggression because russia like the us has not agreed to the treaty. 
Charging_Putin-50|Rush i could also veto any attempt in the un security council to bring the case to the icc. 
Charging_Putin-51|March ukrainian foreign minister demetro haleiwa and former british prime minister gordon brown launched a campaign to create a special tribunal. 
Charging_Putin-52|To try rush up for the crime of aggression in ukraine. 
Charging_Putin-53|The tribunal will need the backing of an international group. 
Charging_Putin-54|Like the un or a collection of nations. 
Charging_Putin-55|For example after wwii the nuremberg tribunal was established by the us britain france and the former soviet union to try nazi leaders. 
Charging_Putin-56|Alex served as a un prosecutor in kosovo and cambodia. 
Charging_Putin-57|I'm just now teaching at the university of leeds law school. 
Charging_Putin-58|He said the evidence against russia is very strong. 
Charging_Putin-59|But he added there's no way on earth putin will surrender to the icc. 
Charging_Putin-60|Or be arrested and brought to the icc. 
Charging_Putin-61|Last month. 
Charging_Putin-62|Icc prosecutor sought to arrest. 
Charging_Putin-63|3 russian generals for possible war crimes in the 2008 war against neighboring georgia. 
Charging_Putin-64|They have not surrendered so far.

Chicago-42|Ben omicron is worse for children than previous variance. 
Chicago-43|Biden said last week. 
Chicago-44|We know that our kids can be safe when in school. 
Chicago-45|But the reality for some districts is not so simple. 
Chicago-46|Testing supplies have been limited. 
Chicago-47|And many districts have low vaccination rates in their communities. 
Chicago-48|In detroit michigan just 44% of people 55 and older have received a vaccine shot. 
Chicago-49|And the school system has moved to online learning. 
Chicago-50|At least the first two weeks of 2022. 
Chicago-51|Nikolai vitti is the head of the detroit school system. 
Chicago-52|He wrote to parents that because of low vaccination rates among students and families. 
Chicago-53|A return to the classroom would lead to extreme levels of positive cases.

Chicago-64|He said it was more difficult for him to pay attention. 
Chicago-65|While remote learning. 
Chicago-66|As infections reach record levels in some areas. 
Chicago-67|Some parents agree with the decision to move instruction online. 
Chicago-68|Rebecca caldwell is a parent in charleston illinois. 
Chicago-69|She is asking her school district to give families the choice of online learning. 
Chicago-70|They say kids do well if infected. 
Chicago-71|Refuse to say my kid is not going to be that one.

Chinese_Students-1|The chair is a new program. 
Chinese_Students-2|About life at an american university that might be of interest to foreign students coming to the united states. 
Chinese_Students-3|The main actor in the show is sandra oh. 
Chinese_Students-4|In the chair. 
Chinese_Students-5|Who plays ji-hoon kim. 
Chinese_Students-6|An english professor. 
Chinese_Students-7|At a fictional college in the north-eastern us. 
Chinese_Students-8|When the show begins. 
Chinese_Students-9|Kim is in her first days as the leader. 
Chinese_Students-10|Or chair of her department. 
Chinese_Students-11|She's the first woman to have the job. 
Chinese_Students-12|Kim overseas a group of professors. 
Chinese_Students-13|And also talks often with another official of the university. 
Chinese_Students-14|Adine. 
Chinese_Students-15|They discussed many issues. 
Chinese_Students-16|These include. 
Chinese_Students-17|How to increase the number of students in english classes. 
Chinese_Students-18|How to add more professors and different races and ethnic groups. 
Chinese_Students-19|And whether older unpopular professors should keep their jobs. 
Chinese_Students-20|The show brings up problems facing college professors and their leaders in 2021. 
Chinese_Students-21|It talks about how black professors feel while working at schools. 
Chinese_Students-22|Where the students and teachers are mostly white. 
Chinese_Students-23|He talks about whether universities should change the system of offering tenure to professors. 
Chinese_Students-24|And it asks if professors should have the freedom to teach the way they believe they should. 
Chinese_Students-25|It also looks at the trouble kim has. 
Chinese_Students-26|Dealing with her job and her home life. 
Chinese_Students-27|She is a single parent of a young adopted daughter. 
Chinese_Students-28|And has a retired father who lives in the same town. 
Chinese_Students-29|Oh's character speaks korean with her father and tries to teach the language to her daughter. 
Chinese_Students-30|All the issues come up in just six programs. 
Chinese_Students-31|The show is not real. 
Chinese_Students-32|And is a comedy. 
Chinese_Students-33|It is not trying to be a real record like a documentary. 
Chinese_Students-34|But it does present. 
Chinese_Students-35|Real problems at colleges. 
Chinese_Students-36|So how well does the chair show life on a college campus in 2021. 
Chinese_Students-37|Jay bielski is a professor of human development at the university of california davis. 
Chinese_Students-38|Bielski started his work in higher education. 
Chinese_Students-39|In the 1970s when he completed degrees at cornell university in new york. 
Chinese_Students-40|He said the stories presented by the chair. 
Chinese_Students-41|Are close to life on a college campus in 2021. 
Chinese_Students-42|However. 
Chinese_Students-43|It is unlikely all the difficult events would happen at once. 
Chinese_Students-44|In addition belsky said pembroke. 
Chinese_Students-45|The fictional college of the chair. 
Chinese_Students-46|Only represents the environment that a small number of us universities. 
Chinese_Students-48|Some of the innocent political correctness is it all of them. 
Chinese_Students-49|It's probably a lot more. 
Chinese_Students-50|Intention apparent that all-encompassing at those elite of elite schools. 
Chinese_Students-51|Shara bala is in her final year of study at dartmouth college in new hampshire. 
Chinese_Students-52|Dartmouth is one of the oldest colleges in the us and an ivy league school. 
Chinese_Students-53|Bala wrote about the chair for the dartmouth. 
Chinese_Students-54|The student newspaper. 
Chinese_Students-55|In her report she wrote that the show captures the peculiarities. 
Chinese_Students-56|Of life on a college campus. 
Chinese_Students-57|And noted. 
Chinese_Students-58|That it balance is being a comedy with. 
Chinese_Students-59|Tragic reality. 
Chinese_Students-60|She also commented that the outdoor scenes from the chair. 
Chinese_Students-61|Reminded her of dartmouth. 
Chinese_Students-62|Although the show was mostly filmed in pennsylvania. 
Chinese_Students-63|Is the chair good to watch for a student considering study in the us. 
Chinese_Students-64|Bala thought of her mother who grew up in malaysia. 
Chinese_Students-65|She said her mother often asked whether life at an american high school and college. 
Chinese_Students-66|Was like the life shown in movies and television. 
Chinese_Students-67|Yeah i think for a student from. 
Chinese_Students-68|From a jar for from anywhere on outside america. 
Chinese_Students-69|I think it could be a very interesting show to watch. 
Chinese_Students-70|Bala approved of the show's attempt to show an asian woman as a university leader she noted that us universities are currently. 
Chinese_Students-71|Having really important conversations about diversity. 
Chinese_Students-72|Those parents came to canada from south korea in the 1960s. 
Chinese_Students-73|Speaking to the associated press. 
Chinese_Students-74|She said it was important that her character had a korean first name. 
Chinese_Students-75|Her best-known television characters have been named christina and eve. 
Chinese_Students-76|To be actually able to put a korean name and have all the characters say your name. 
Chinese_Students-77|It really appealed to me i was sad. 
Chinese_Students-78|The chair is the first movie or television show in a number of years to tell a story about a professor at an american college. 
Chinese_Students-79|Some critics said it is the first to do so since the wonder boys. 
Chinese_Students-80|That film came out over 20 years ago. 
Chinese_Students-81|The chair shows two sides of kim's life. 
Chinese_Students-82|As a university l and there's a single parent. 
Chinese_Students-83|While mama is a young person. 
Chinese_Students-84|She has experience with academia because she followed her father. 
Chinese_Students-85|Who is a professor at the university of kansas. 
Chinese_Students-86|She said she's glad the show tries to show. 
Chinese_Students-87|Current college life. 
Chinese_Students-88|The show definitely has kind of this. 
Chinese_Students-89|Current perspective which was. 
Chinese_Students-90|Refreshing. 
Chinese_Students-91|To see in a show of academia. 
Chinese_Students-92|Belsky the human development professor. 
Chinese_Students-93|Said it is important to remember that kim leads the school's english department. 
Chinese_Students-94|He proposed that a show about engineering or chemistry. 
Chinese_Students-95|Might be very different. 
Chinese_Students-96|I think you really have to. 
Chinese_Students-97|Make a distinction between. 
Chinese_Students-98|Humanities and social sciences versus the rest of. 
Chinese_Students-99|Campus. 
Chinese_Students-100|Bielski also proposed that while the show is getting noticed it is possible that it may only connect with a small percentage of americans. 
Chinese_Students-101|Not many people in the us attended schools like the one in the chair. 
Chinese_Students-102|Bala thought one part of the show was. 
Chinese_Students-103|Overstated. 
Chinese_Students-104|The idea that older professors are out of touch and unable to connect. 
Chinese_Students-105|Current college students. 
Chinese_Students-106|I've been really lucky to have professors who are. 
Chinese_Students-107|Are jatak trillion and like on top of any new developments and their fields. 
Chinese_Students-108|I'm dan friedel. 
Choose_Native-1|From voa learning english. 
Choose_Native-2|This is the health and lifestyle report. 
Choose_Native-3|Jessica damiano's moved into a new home in the spring of 2005. 
Choose_Native-4|At the time the only plants growing in the garden. 
Choose_Native-5|We're a rhododendron bush. 
Choose_Native-6|A few daffodil flowers. 
Choose_Native-7|And some ferns. 
Choose_Native-8|A month later she was delighted to see a flowering plant start to grow. 
Choose_Native-9|She did not know the name of the beautiful purple plant. 
Choose_Native-10|But that did not matter to her. 
Choose_Native-11|She loved it. 
Choose_Native-12|Two years later damiana graduated from cornell university master gardener program. 
Choose_Native-13|She worked as a gardening writer for a local newspaper. 
Choose_Native-14|That is when she found out the truth. 
Choose_Native-15|She discovered that her favorite plant was called purple loosestrife. 
Choose_Native-16|And that it was considered invasive. 
Choose_Native-17|In her home state of new york. 
Choose_Native-18|However she told herself that the plant was not spreading on the property. 
Choose_Native-19|And that it was not out of control. 
Choose_Native-20|Then she learned more. 
Choose_Native-21|Some plants known to be invasive. 
Choose_Native-22|Or what damien o calls wolves in sheep's clothing. 
Choose_Native-23|This means they may seem harmless and well contained in the garden. 
Choose_Native-24|But become harmful in other places. 
Choose_Native-25|Birds eat the seeds of invasive plants and spread them to other places. 
Choose_Native-26|Those seeds grow into new plants that outgrow native plants. 
Choose_Native-27|Damiano's said this is because. 
Choose_Native-28|Invasive plants often are not eaten by local wildlife. 
Choose_Native-29|Which would otherwise keep them under control. 
Choose_Native-30|If not controlled invasive plants grow larger. 
Choose_Native-31|And push out native plants that provide food and shelter for birds insects and small animals. 
Choose_Native-32|This harms the local environment. 
Choose_Native-33|Many state environmental agencies ban the sale and use of plants found to be harmful to human. 
Choose_Native-34|Or illogical health. 
Choose_Native-35|But some invasive plans are not officially considered invasive. 
Choose_Native-36|Others may be listed as invasive in one area. 
Choose_Native-37|But not another. 
Choose_Native-38|And some invasive plans continue to be sold in stores. 
Choose_Native-39|So what is a gardener to do. 
Choose_Native-40|Damiano's says to avoid any plants sold as vigorous. 
Choose_Native-41|Fast spreading. 
Choose_Native-42|Quick climbing. 
Choose_Native-43|Or a rapid self sower. 
Choose_Native-44|She warns that these are all sellers code words for invasive plant. 
Choose_Native-45|Next learn about your local area. 
Choose_Native-46|Which plants are invasive. 
Choose_Native-47|And which plants are native. 
Choose_Native-48|Ask government agencies universities and colleges. 
Choose_Native-49|And environmental groups. 
Choose_Native-50|You can also do your own research at libraries or online. 
Choose_Native-51|In the end damiano's says she pulled the purple loosestrife from her garden. 
Choose_Native-52|The us environmental protection agency warns. 
Choose_Native-53|That the plant clogs rivers and lakes. 
Choose_Native-54|It also grows so thick. 
Choose_Native-55|That boat and swimmers can't get through. 
Choose_Native-56|It also destroys food and habitat for fish and water birds. 
Choose_Native-57|She replaced that plant with the native and equally beautiful blazing star plant. 
Choose_Native-58|This plant has been growing happily without problems in her garden for the past 15 years. 
Choose_Native-59|And that's the health and lifestyle report. 
Choose_Native-60|I'm on a mateo.

Claims_US-24|Is that the schools did not always choose the best students. 
Claims_US-25|The school's chose students for reasons such as their ability to pay the full price of college. 
Claims_US-26|Universities will often accept the best students and then make a list of second-place students. 
Claims_US-27|That may be accepted later. 
Claims_US-28|The decisions made about students on that list may be an important part of the lawsuit. 
Claims_US-29|Danielle douglas gabriel writes about higher education for the washington post.

Claims_US-31|May have broken what is known as antitrust law.

Claims_US-44|The lawyer is also claimed that some universities limited the amount of money given to needy students. 
Claims_US-45|By keeping places open for the children of wealthy donors. 
Claims_US-46|Or graduates who could pay the full cost. 
Claims_US-47|The university's saved. 
Claims_US-48|Hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Claims_US-49|The lawsuit represents both students and parents who paid tuition. 
Claims_US-50|Spokespeople from several universities said their schools plan to defend themselves. 
Claims_US-51|They are following the law they say. 
Claims_US-52|International students cannot receive financial aid from the us government but. 
Claims_US-53|Some do receive money from the universities who want to have a diverse student group. 
Claims_US-54|The lawsuit asks for a jury trial.

Claims_US-61|To find that there is fire where this smoke is being sent up today. 
Claims_US-62|Douglas gabriel said she thinks the schools will work hard to get the courts to throw out the lawsuit. 
Claims_US-63|It's accusations could be very damaging. 
Claims_US-64|Harvard university is not named in the lawsuit because it is not a member of the 568 president's group. 
Claims_US-65|Harvard did not join the group when it formed. 
Claims_US-66|Because the school said it wanted to make more money available to students. 
Claims_US-67|I'm the infidel. 
Climate_Change-1|A new study predicts that climate change will cause thousands of new viruses to spread among many kinds of animals by 2070. 
Climate_Change-2|The researchers say such spread. 
Climate_Change-3|Will likely increase the risk of new diseases that passed from animals to humans. 
Climate_Change-4|The research covered about 3,000 kinds of mammals. 
Climate_Change-5|Animals including cats. 
Climate_Change-6|Bats whales and humans to name a few.

Climate_Change-8|Recent research has suggested that such a temperature rise is possible. 
Climate_Change-9|The team said the model predicted that cross-species virus spread. 
Climate_Change-10|Will happen more than 4,000 times among mammals. 
Climate_Change-11|The researchers said not all viruses will spread to humans. 
Climate_Change-12|Or lead to widespread pandemics like covid-19. 
Climate_Change-13|However the study suggests that the high number of cross-species viruses will increase the risk of spread to humans. 
Climate_Change-14|The findings recently appeared in the publication nature. 
Climate_Change-15|The study points to two major worldwide crisis. 
Climate_Change-16|That could cause diseases to be passed from animals to humans climate change. 
Climate_Change-17|And infectious disease spread. 
Climate_Change-18|Past research has looked at how deforestation the disappearance of species and the wildlife trade can lead to animal human disease spread. 
Climate_Change-19|But there has been less research on how climate change. 
Climate_Change-20|Could influence this kind of disease spread. 
Climate_Change-21|The researchers said. 
Climate_Change-22|We don't talk about climate alot in the context of zoonosis. 
Climate_Change-23|Said study co-writer colon carlson. 
Climate_Change-24|A professor of biology at georgetown university in washington dc. 
Climate_Change-25|Zoonosis is a term for diseases that can spread from animals to people. 
Climate_Change-26|Our study brings together the two most pressing global crises we have carlson added. 
Climate_Change-27|Many experts on climate change and infectious disease. 
Climate_Change-28|Agree that a warming planet. 
Climate_Change-29|Will likely lead to increased risk that new viruses will be created. 
Climate_Change-30|Daniel r brooks is a biologist at the university of nebraska state museum and co-author of the book. 
Climate_Change-31|The stockholm paradigm climate change and emerging disease. 
Climate_Change-32|He told the associated press that the latest study supports the idea that new disease threats can be linked to climate change. 
Climate_Change-33|This particular contribution is an extremely conservative estimate for possible new infectious disease spread caused by climate change brooks said. 
Climate_Change-34|Aaron bernstein is a medical doctor and current director of the centre for climate. 
Climate_Change-35|Helps and the global environment. 
Climate_Change-36|At harvard university's. 
Climate_Change-37|Th chan school of public health. 
Climate_Change-39|He said the study confirms long-held suspicions about the effects planet warming can have on the creation of new infectious diseases he noted that the study suggests such cases may already be happening with greater frequency and in places near where many people live. 
Climate_Change-40|Bernstein said. 
Climate_Change-41|Study co-writer gregory aubrey is a disease expert at georgetown university. 
Climate_Change-42|He told the ap that because climate driven infectious diseases are likely already being created. 
Climate_Change-43|The world should be doing more to learn about and prepare for it. 
Climate_Change-44|It's not preventable even in the best-case climate change scenarios.

College_Athletes-11|However. 
College_Athletes-12|They were not permitted to make money from their fame. 
College_Athletes-13|Until becoming professionals and joining the national basketball association. 
College_Athletes-14|After they became professionals. 
College_Athletes-15|They could get paid by their teams and do advertisements. 
College_Athletes-16|For companies like nike. 
College_Athletes-17|Now however thanks to a decision by the us supreme court last june. 
College_Athletes-18|American college athletes.

College_Athletes-20|The athletes can make money by permitting businesses to use their name image. 
College_Athletes-21|And likeness to sell a product. 
College_Athletes-22|The agreements are called nil deals. 
College_Athletes-23|As a result. 
College_Athletes-24|Some university athletes are becoming wealthy at age 20. 
College_Athletes-25|Others may not become wealthy but they want money to fall back on. 
College_Athletes-26|That means they will have some saved money. 
College_Athletes-27|Even if they do not have a long sports career.

College_Athletes-44|It'll set me up for life. 
College_Athletes-45|Kelly said. 
College_Athletes-46|Meaning she hopes to not have financial worries in the future. 
College_Athletes-47|Most of the time it is easier for male athletes to make money with nil deals. 
College_Athletes-48|Because their sports are seen by more people. 
College_Athletes-49|However. 
College_Athletes-50|Some female athletes are doing well.

College_StudentS_Korean-50|When i felt like i was a fake korean. 
College_StudentS_Korean-51|She said. 
College_StudentS_Korean-52|But i realized over the process that we can only really represent our own story. 
College_StudentS_Korean-53|And that's totally okay. 
College_StudentS_Korean-54|There's no such thing as one way to be korean. 
College_StudentS_Korean-55|The tik-tok-videos have not just helped create attention for the project. 
College_StudentS_Korean-56|They have also helped her develop and change it.

Colleges-20|Christina howard is graduating from the university of chicago in june. 
Colleges-21|She said she never could have imagined. 
Colleges-22|Did almost half of her time in college. 
Colleges-23|Would be affected by the pandemic. 
Colleges-24|Weird feeling to be doing this again in my last year i really hope so.. 
Colleges-25|I would get a full year to finish. 
Colleges-26|On a more normal kind of note but. 
Colleges-27|I guess that's not going to happen. 
Colleges-28|When asked whether she thinks the university will start on the new date. 
Colleges-29|She said. 
Colleges-30|We'll see. 
Colleges-31|Some schools including northeastern university in boston massachusetts and georgetown university in washington dc. 
Colleges-32|Are asking students to get an additional shot of vaccine. 
Colleges-33|Also known as a booster. 
Colleges-34|Sue lawrenson is the vice dean for undergraduate education at georgetown. 
Colleges-35|She told voa the university will require all students and professors. 
Colleges-36|To have a covid-19 booster shot by january 21st. 
Colleges-37|Georgetown plans to start classes online. 
Colleges-38|Before moving to in-person classes on january 31st. 
Colleges-39|The hope lawrence and said. 
Colleges-40|Is that the number of covid-19 cases in washington will decrease by mid-january. 
Colleges-41|One thing that i think will make a big difference to students this time around is that compared to last year students are able to return to their residence halls on campus as originally scheduled. 
Colleges-42|In mid-january. 
Colleges-43|Which will allow them to reconnect with their classmates. 
Colleges-44|Can henderson is a top leader at northeastern he told the associated press. 
Colleges-45|But he thinks covid-19 is becoming endemic. 
Colleges-46|And the school wants to control covid effectively not let covid control us. 
Colleges-47|Endemic means the virus will continue to exist in some areas. 
Colleges-48|But will not affect all the people in all areas. 
Colleges-49|Like a pandemic. 
Colleges-50|In the central part of the us. 
Colleges-51|The university of illinois plans to have students come back to classes in person. 
Colleges-52|After a one-week delay. 
Colleges-53|Robin koller is a spokeswoman for the university. 
Colleges-54|She said the university expects a spike. 
Colleges-55|When students come back. 
Colleges-56|We want to make sure we're on top of that. 
Colleges-57|So we can crusher. 
Colleges-58|As quickly as possible she said. 
Colleges-59|Jake maynard is a student at george washington university. 
Colleges-60|Another college in the nation's capital. 
Colleges-61|He said. 
Colleges-62|He is fine with the week of online classes. 
Colleges-63|But beyond that. 
Colleges-64|He hopes officials trust in the booster shots. 
Colleges-65|And provide a traditional college experience. 
Colleges-66|I'm a junior. 
Colleges-67|But about half my schooling experience has been online. 
Colleges-68|Maynard told the associated press. 
Colleges-69|You lose so much of what makes the school the school. 
Colleges-70|I'm dan friedel. 
Comfortable_Changes-1|As american slowly return to the office. 
Comfortable_Changes-2|They are rethinking their clothing choices at work. 
Comfortable_Changes-3|After two years of working from home in exercise clothes. 
Comfortable_Changes-4|Many people now want to be comfortable. 
Comfortable_Changes-5|While looking professional in the office. 
Comfortable_Changes-6|Some people are experimenting with new looks. 
Comfortable_Changes-7|And companies are trying to keep up. 
Comfortable_Changes-8|With the demand for business comfort clothing.

Comfortable_Changes-14|Before the pandemic. 
Comfortable_Changes-15|Now she wears comfortable clothes including stylish jeans. 
Comfortable_Changes-16|I'm flowing shirts. 
Comfortable_Changes-17|Along with lower heel shoes. 
Comfortable_Changes-18|Being comfortable is more important than being super structured. 
Comfortable_Changes-19|Said martin pence. 
Comfortable_Changes-20|She added that she will never wear dress pants to the office again. 
Comfortable_Changes-21|Adam gilinsky is a social psychologist. 
Comfortable_Changes-22|At columbia business school. 
Comfortable_Changes-23|He studies the connection between what people wear. 
Comfortable_Changes-24|And how they think. 
Comfortable_Changes-25|Kolinsky said that people will knowingly think. 
Comfortable_Changes-26|About what they will wear to the office. 
Comfortable_Changes-27|They may compare themselves to others. 
Comfortable_Changes-28|And think about the situation they are in. 
Comfortable_Changes-29|He said that back to work clothes are still a social experiment. 
Comfortable_Changes-30|And the decision of what to wear. 
Comfortable_Changes-31|Could go either way. 
Comfortable_Changes-32|My guess is that it will go more casual. 
Comfortable_Changes-33|But maybe it doesn't. 
Comfortable_Changes-34|Galinski said. 
Comfortable_Changes-35|Clothing companies are also seeing the changing demand. 
Comfortable_Changes-36|The market research npd group.

Comfortable_Changes-42|The most common kind of shoe. 
Comfortable_Changes-43|For the workplace is sneakers. 
Comfortable_Changes-44|And even those sales of dress shoes have increased slightly. 
Comfortable_Changes-45|Sales are still 34% lower. 
Comfortable_Changes-46|Dad in 2019. 
Comfortable_Changes-47|The increase is likely to come from more social gatherings and not work places. 
Comfortable_Changes-48|Rent the runway. 
Comfortable_Changes-49|A rental clothing company. 
Comfortable_Changes-50|Said that rentals of blazers are two times higher. 
Comfortable_Changes-51|10 last year. 
Comfortable_Changes-52|Because people are returning to work. 
Comfortable_Changes-53|But people are choosing more colorful and lightweight clothes. 
Comfortable_Changes-54|Traditional business where rentals are still down. 
Comfortable_Changes-55|By about 50%. 
Comfortable_Changes-56|Compared to pre-pandemic rentals. 
Comfortable_Changes-57|For men.

Comfortable_Changes-65|10 buttons zippers. 
Comfortable_Changes-66|Brooks brothers produced few casual clothes before the pandemic.

Comfortable_Changes-77|Stevensville michigan. 
Comfortable_Changes-78|She said she is spending money on new clothes that include blue jeans shirts and even blazers. 
Comfortable_Changes-79|As a mother of a young child she wants to feel her best when she leaves the house. 
Comfortable_Changes-80|It's kind of fun to dress up kerchner set. 
Comfortable_Changes-81|It's kind of like that back-to-school feeling. 
Comfortable_Changes-82|I'm faced pirlo. 
Conflicts-1|At school board meetings across the united states in 2021. 
Conflicts-2|Parents physically fought each other. 
Conflicts-3|Others shouted and threatened school board members. 
Conflicts-4|These disagreements. 
Conflicts-5|Even entered state politics. 
Conflicts-6|Like the 2021 virginia governor's race. 
Conflicts-7|The issues included how race. 
Conflicts-8|Racism. 
Conflicts-9|And transgendered student rights are taught. 
Conflicts-10|Most of the media attention last year. 
Conflicts-11|Also centered on critical race theory. 
Conflicts-12|For sun. 
Conflicts-13|Critical race theory or crt. 
Conflicts-14|Is a way of understanding how race has shaped american society and public policy. 
Conflicts-15|For others. 
Conflicts-16|Crt creates division and conflict between white people and minorities. 
Conflicts-17|The theory however is not being taught to public school students in the country. 
Conflicts-18|Kate phillipo is a professor at loyola university in chicago. 
Conflicts-19|Joseph vrare teaches at the university of washington. 
Conflicts-20|These two researchers said these conflicts are likely to continue into the new year. 
Conflicts-21|And they shared their observations on the website. 
Conflicts-22|The conversation. 
Conflicts-23|In 2022. 
Conflicts-24|Conflicts over online education. 
Conflicts-25|Are likely to increase. 
Conflicts-26|With the spread of the omicron variant. 
Conflicts-27|And the required vaccinations. 
Conflicts-28|For all students. 
Conflicts-29|The issue is whether parents should have control over how public money is spent on educating their children. 
Conflicts-30|This could lead to risk. 
Conflicts-31|Moving money away. 
Conflicts-32|From public schools to others. 
Conflicts-33|Like religious. 
Conflicts-34|Private. 
Conflicts-35|And charter schools. 
Conflicts-36|By last autumn. 
Conflicts-37|Schools in the us largely return. 
Conflicts-38|To in-person classes. 
Conflicts-39|However demand for homeschooling and online schooling has risen. 
Conflicts-40|Parents have discovered that those choices offer more control over the use of time. 
Conflicts-41|What their children learn. 
Conflicts-42|And safety from the coronavirus. 
Conflicts-43|In washington state. 
Conflicts-44|The number of students choosing online education has greatly increased at for-profit schools. 
Conflicts-45|It receive public money. 
Conflicts-46|One company washington virtual academy. 
Conflicts-47|Saw a student body increase of about 85%. 
Conflicts-48|From 2020. 
Conflicts-49|220 21. 
Conflicts-50|Schools across the country saw a similar movement. 
Conflicts-51|And school choice supporters argued that parental demand. 
Conflicts-52|For online education would continue. 
Conflicts-53|Ferrari and several others studied the effects of online education. 
Conflicts-54|Compared to in-person classes among students. 
Conflicts-55|They found that students who switch to online schools. 
Conflicts-56|Experienced considerable learning losses. 
Conflicts-57|In reading and math. 
Conflicts-58|During each of the three years after switching. 
Conflicts-59|That evidence has forced policymakers. 
Conflicts-60|To consider greater control over online schools. 
Conflicts-61|Some american universities consider the race of a student along with other qualities. 
Conflicts-62|Like economic status for college admission. 
Conflicts-63|In 2022. 
Conflicts-64|Legal cases involving affirmative action. 
Conflicts-65|Will likely create more disagreement on education in america. 
Conflicts-66|Affirmative action is a practice or a policy. 
Conflicts-67|Of helping individuals belonging to groups. 
Conflicts-68|Known to have been discriminated against previously. 
Conflicts-69|This year the case of students for fair admissions vs. harvard university. 
Conflicts-70|Well reach the us supreme court. 
Conflicts-71|The group argued that harvard held asian-americans. 
Conflicts-72|To a higher standard to give preference to black and hispanic students. 
Conflicts-73|With lower grades. 
Conflicts-74|Harvard says it uses race as one of many things. 
Conflicts-75|It considers in admissions decisions. 
Conflicts-76|It believes considering raise can help create a mixed community. 
Conflicts-77|Where students from all walks of life. 
Conflicts-78|Can learn with and from each other. 
Conflicts-79|In 2022. 
Conflicts-80|Teachers unions may continue to exercise their power. 
Conflicts-81|Even with ongoing efforts by parents. 
Conflicts-82|And other groups. 
Conflicts-83|2 limited. 
Conflicts-84|A union is an organization that represents the interests of workers. 
Conflicts-85|Last year teachers unions effectively negotiated increased health safety measures. 
Conflicts-86|Against the spread of covid-19. 
Conflicts-87|In cities including new york. 
Conflicts-88|And los angeles. 
Conflicts-89|In january a dispute over the covid-19 safety measures. 
Conflicts-90|Kept 350,000 students from in-person classes in chicago for 5 days. 
Conflicts-91|The teachers returned after school officials agreed to expand covid-19 testing. 
Conflicts-92|And establish rules. 
Conflicts-93|For when to close schools during outbreaks. 
Conflicts-94|These winds signal the ability of teachers unions to negotiate on issues. 
Conflicts-95|Like working conditions and pay. 
Conflicts-96|With shortages of qualified pictures. 
Conflicts-97|Unions negotiation power may intensify. 
Conflicts-98|American school systems usually have gifted education programs. 
Conflicts-99|For students that show a high level of success. 
Conflicts-100|Many programs began as efforts to keep white families. 
Conflicts-101|From leaving racially diverse public schools in urban areas. 
Conflicts-102|They were created to compete with high-performing private schools. 
Conflicts-103|Such programs have been under much criticism in recent years. 
Conflicts-104|Critics say they were saying racial divisions and inequality in the country's education system. 
Conflicts-105|An associated press study of recent federal data. 
Conflicts-106|Found that nationwide. 
Conflicts-107|8.1% of white.

Conflicts-109|Anna public schools are considered gifted. 
Conflicts-110|But only 4.5% of hispanic. 
Conflicts-111|And 3.5% of black students are identified as gifted. 
Conflicts-112|In 2022. 
Conflicts-113|Gifted education may become a national debate. 
Conflicts-114|So far it has been centered in new york city. 
Conflicts-115|But it may spread.

Controlled_Burn-1|in the 1950s
Controlled_Burn-2|University of California Professor Harold bizwell
Controlled_Burn-3|experimented with controlled Burns in the state's forests
Controlled_Burn-4|at the time
Controlled_Burn-5|many people thought he was insane to do so
Controlled_Burn-6|now however
Controlled_Burn-7|as well as seem not as insane but as someone whose research could he's Wildfire dangers
Controlled_Burn-8|and save the forest
Controlled_Burn-9|of the American West
Controlled_Burn-10|large areas of forest have become overgrown in the American West
Controlled_Burn-11|these lands have had wildfires that have damaged towns
Controlled_Burn-12|Forest large evacuations
Controlled_Burn-13|and covered the West Coast in Thick Smoke
Controlled_Burn-14|today
Controlled_Burn-15|officials want to greatly increase prescribed fires
Controlled_Burn-16|fire set on purpose
Controlled_Burn-17|and under carefully controlled conditions
Controlled_Burn-18|prescribed fires help clear surface fuels in forests
Controlled_Burn-19|last month
Controlled_Burn-20|four US senators proposed legislation called the national prescribed fire Act of 2021
Controlled_Burn-21|it's called for federal officials to substantially increase the number and size
Controlled_Burn-22|I've prescribed fires on federal lands
Controlled_Burn-23|one of the Bill's supporters
Controlled_Burn-24|Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon
Controlled_Burn-25|said the legislation would double the budget for controlled Burns
Controlled_Burn-26|it took years for Forest managers to come around to accept prescribed burning
Controlled_Burn-27|in the first half of the 20th century
Controlled_Burn-28|fire was seen as the enemy
Controlled_Burn-29|federal and state forest managers believed prescribed burning damaged the environment
Controlled_Burn-30|especially Timber
Controlled_Burn-31|wood manufactured to build things
Controlled_Burn-32|but in the late 1960s and 1970s
Controlled_Burn-33|Federal Forest managers began using prescribed Burns
Controlled_Burn-34|yet the increase in prescribed Burns has been slow
Controlled_Burn-35|from 1995 through 2000
Controlled_Burn-36|an average of 566560 hectares
Controlled_Burn-37|we're treated with prescribed fire each year
Controlled_Burn-38|that amount is far short of the 28 million hectares
Controlled_Burn-39|that in 2001
Controlled_Burn-40|where in great need of fuel reduction to avoid serious wildfires
Controlled_Burn-41|scientist David Carl wrote in his 2002 book
Controlled_Burn-42|burning questions
Controlled_Burn-43|America's fight with Nature's fire
Controlled_Burn-44|the latest prescribed burning plans face several problems
Controlled_Burn-45|the periods between Wildfire Seasons when prescribed burning can happen safely
Controlled_Burn-46|are shrinking
Controlled_Burn-47|some forests are too overgrown to burn without thinning
Controlled_Burn-48|and prescribed fires can fill nearby towns in Smoke
Controlled_Burn-49|Tim whole stock is Deputy Chief of policy and planning with Oregon's Department of Forestry
Controlled_Burn-50|we have to be mindful of not pouring smoke into communities
Controlled_Burn-51|because that's a violation of the Clean Air Act
Controlled_Burn-52|ostokset
Controlled_Burn-53|prescribed burning has prevented disasters
Controlled_Burn-54|in 2017 a wildfire threatened the town of Sisters Oregon
Controlled_Burn-55|but firefighters were able to control it because months earlier
Controlled_Burn-56|workers had removed trees and fresh and then carried out prescribed Burns
Controlled_Burn-57|the fire came to a halt
Controlled_Burn-58|both because it had less fuels
Controlled_Burn-59|and also because in the thinned more natural Forest
Controlled_Burn-60|there was a lot more space for the firefighters
Controlled_Burn-61|said Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon
Controlled_Burn-62|he leads the Senate interior environment and related agencies Appropriations subcommittee
Controlled_Burn-63|however
Controlled_Burn-64|sometimes prescribed Burns become uncontrollable
Controlled_Burn-65|one of the most destructive Burns happened in 2012
Controlled_Burn-66|the Colorado State Forest Service did a 20 ha prescribed burn near the small town of Conifer
Controlled_Burn-67|Southwest of Denver
Controlled_Burn-68|the fire appeared to go out that's expected
Controlled_Burn-69|but
Controlled_Burn-70|high winds brought it back to life
Controlled_Burn-71|several people died in the fire which burned 15.5 square kilometers
Controlled_Burn-72|and destroyed over 20 homes
Controlled_Burn-73|Scott Stevens
Controlled_Burn-74|a professor of Wildland fire science at the University of California
Controlled_Burn-75|Berkeley
Controlled_Burn-76|once a big increase in prescribed Burns
Controlled_Burn-77|but Stephens predict
Controlled_Burn-78|search Burns will only slowly increase
Controlled_Burn-79|due to a lack of both trained workers
Controlled_Burn-80|and public support
Controlled_Burn-81|once you get areas treated
Controlled_Burn-82|you have to come back in around 15 years for maintenance treatments
Controlled_Burn-83|and just never ends
Controlled_Burn-84|Stevens said
Controlled_Burn-85|this is a key point
Controlled_Burn-86|the program has to last forever

Cyberattacks-90|A disgusting way to get money. 
Cyberattacks-91|Because it hurts children. 
Cyberattacks-92|The crimes are creating debates on how to stop the attacks. 
Cyberattacks-93|Some people say teachers should use paper. 
Cyberattacks-94|To keep track of student information instead of databases but. 
Cyberattacks-95|Many teachers say that would make their work take much longer. 
Cyberattacks-96|The crimes are also causing school systems and states to spend more money than usual. 
Cyberattacks-97|In new mexico state leaders are working to add 45 million dollars to the budget. 
Cyberattacks-98|To create a cybersecurity program by 2027.

Cyberattacks-104|I'm the infidel. 
Dartmouth-1|The maker of a test. 
Dartmouth-2|Some colleges use to decide who to accept. 
Dartmouth-3|Bsat. 
Dartmouth-4|Said it will stop offering students paper test. 
Dartmouth-5|By 2024. 
Dartmouth-6|The sat is a standardized test. 
Dartmouth-7|That means it is the same for everyone who takes it on the same date. 
Dartmouth-8|The college board in new york city creates the ssat and psat test. 
Dartmouth-9|Most american students take these tests. 
Dartmouth-10|Before applying to college. 
Dartmouth-11|The organization said it will no longer provide paper test. 
Dartmouth-12|For international students in 2023. 
Dartmouth-13|And a year later for american students. 
Dartmouth-14|The test also will be one hour shorter. 
Dartmouth-15|And given to students on a computer. 
Dartmouth-16|The organisation said. 
Dartmouth-17|However students will still need to take the test. 
Dartmouth-18|At a school or testing center. 
Dartmouth-19|Priscilla rodriguez is the vice president for college readiness. 
Dartmouth-20|At the college board. 
Dartmouth-21|She said the test will be easier to take. 
Dartmouth-22|Easier to give. 
Dartmouth-23|And more relevant. 
Dartmouth-24|The sat tests a student's knowledge of math. 
Dartmouth-25|Reading and writing. 
Dartmouth-26|It takes at least three hours to complete. 
Dartmouth-27|A number of colleges and universities made the sat and the competing act optional. 
Dartmouth-28|When testing centers closed because of the covid-19 pandemic. 
Dartmouth-29|That means many students are permitted but are not required. 
Dartmouth-30|To send their test scores as part of their college applications. 
Dartmouth-31|A smaller number of schools such as those in the university of california system. 
Dartmouth-32|Decided to stop using the test. 
Dartmouth-33|Completely. 
Dartmouth-34|Some experts wondered if the move to make testing less important. 
Dartmouth-35|Would hurt the testing companies. 
Dartmouth-36|Rodriguez said the college board is working to make the test better for a computer. 
Dartmouth-37|And not just moving the paper test to a digital form. 
Dartmouth-38|We're taking full advantage of what delivering an assessment digitally makes possible. 
Dartmouth-39|She said. 
Dartmouth-40|Assessment is another word for test. 
Dartmouth-41|Even with the change in test requirements. 
Dartmouth-42|1.5 million students. 
Dartmouth-43|Still took the sat in 2021. 
Dartmouth-44|That number however is down from 2.2 million in 2020. 
Dartmouth-45|One organization that opposes standardized tests. 
Dartmouth-46|Is fair test. 
Dartmouth-47|It follows how many universities do not require test scores. 
Dartmouth-48|For students currently applying to college. 
Dartmouth-49|It said about 80% of colleges and universities are now not requiring standardized tests. 
Dartmouth-50|Some students still take the test. 
Dartmouth-51|Even if they do not send in their scores. 
Dartmouth-52|That is because organizations that give out financial aid known as scholarships. 
Dartmouth-53|Sometimes choose students. 
Dartmouth-54|Based on test scores. 
Dartmouth-55|A public opinion study by the college board. 
Dartmouth-56|Showed that students want the sat to continue. 
Dartmouth-57|So they can put their scores on their college applications. 
Dartmouth-58|Rodriguez said her organization will use the test scores. 
Dartmouth-59|To help students connect with job training schools. 
Dartmouth-60|And community colleges. 
Dartmouth-61|And not just four year colleges. 
Dartmouth-62|She said the college board wants to give students more information about what they can do after high school. 
Dartmouth-63|In addition moving to a computer-based test. 
Dartmouth-64|Will make scores available sooner. 
Dartmouth-65|There have been past stories about paper tests getting lost. 
Dartmouth-66|One student from virginia recently took a practice version of the new test. 
Dartmouth-67|Natalia castillo a sixteen-year-old. 
Dartmouth-68|Said the new version was less stressful than the paper test. 
Dartmouth-69|She said the computer test also includes a calculator. 
Dartmouth-70|Which students can use for math problems. 
Dartmouth-71|Which is how many of them do higher-level math in school. 
Dartmouth-72|The college board said students who do not own a computer. 
Dartmouth-73|Or schools which do not have enough computers. 
Dartmouth-74|Will be given computers to use.

Debate_Gifted-27|And that does not include time using media for school. 
Debate_Gifted-28|Pew research said the amount of time that children spent online. 
Debate_Gifted-29|Also increased during the pandemic. 
Debate_Gifted-30|With more time online comes a higher risk of exposure to cyberbullying.

Debate_Gifted-57|Avoiding social situations. 
Debate_Gifted-58|Even ones that were enjoyed in the past. 
Debate_Gifted-59|Becoming depressed or losing interest in people and activities. 
Debate_Gifted-60|Cyberbully is like other forms of bullying and should be handled in a similar way. 
Debate_Gifted-61|If a child is being cyberbullied. 
Debate_Gifted-62|Adults should support the child being bullied. 
Debate_Gifted-63|And address the behavior of the child doing the bullying. 
Debate_Gifted-64|Adults should show children that cyberbullying is something serious. 
Debate_Gifted-65|That should be stopped.

Debate_Gifted-69|As hateful speech violates most websites terms of service. 
Debate_Gifted-70|They can also block the person from posting abusive content. 
Debate_Gifted-71|While ignoring posts might seem easier than blocking someone. 
Debate_Gifted-72|It will not make the problem go away. 
Debate_Gifted-73|Adults can try to make their kids feel more empathy towards others. 
Debate_Gifted-74|And consider how other people feel. 
Debate_Gifted-75|They should see whether more help is needed for those involved. 
Debate_Gifted-76|Like speaking to a guidance counselor or mental health professional. 
Debate_Gifted-77|Cyberbullying may be impossible to stop completely. 
Debate_Gifted-78|But parents could watch their child's behavior and internet time. 
Debate_Gifted-79|France has taken stronger measures against cyberbullying.

Despite_Risk_of_Death-1|International refugee laws. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-2|Fan the return of people to countries where their lives may be in danger. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-3|But refugees aid groups and thai officials themselves.

Despite_Risk_of_Death-5|Since its takeover of the country last year. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-6|Me and mars military has killed more than 1,700 people. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-7|And arrested more than 13,000. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-8|The military has also tortured children women and men. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-9|The refugees are now unsure of their future. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-10|Many live on both sides of the river dividing the two countries. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-11|As fighting continues in myanmar. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-12|Hey is a young woman from myanmar. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-13|She and her family now live in the tall grasses near the river on the thai border. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-14|Like thousands of others. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-15|Hey left her village for neighbouring thailand. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-16|After the military takeover. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-17|Returning to myanmar would place her and her family at risk of death. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-18|But that is what type of fishel's tell them to do at least once a week. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-19|She told the associated press. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-20|The thai government does not want to hurt its relationship with me and mars ruling military.

Despite_Risk_of_Death-29|You've got to be somewhere where it's table. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-30|And there is absolutely no stability in myanmar at the moment. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-31|Thailand has not signed on to the united nations refugee convention. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-32|It claims me and mars refugees return home voluntarily. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-33|Thailand also says it has followed international laws. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-34|Let's say that people must not be returned to a country where they would face torture. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-35|Punishment or harm. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-36|As the situation on the myanmar side of the border improved.

Despite_Risk_of_Death-55|Dividing the two countries. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-56|They carry belongings and babies. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-57|On top of their shoulders. 
Despite_Risk_of_Death-58|They must live in crowded poorly kept shelters.

Duolingo-2|On your mobile phone to learn languages. 
Duolingo-3|Including english. 
Duolingo-4|But the company recently launched an english test. 
Duolingo-5|That it hopes will gain more acceptance. 
Duolingo-6|Like the long-established o'fallon il it's. 
Duolingo-7|Toefl is an english test. 
Duolingo-8|From the american organization educational testing service. 
Duolingo-9|And i outs is owned by the british council and others. 
Duolingo-10|Duolingo was founded in 2011 by luis von ahn. 
Duolingo-11|A professor at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh. 
Duolingo-12|Along with one of his students. 
Duolingo-13|The company launched its duolingo app a year later. 
Duolingo-14|It now provides learning instruction for over 40 languages. 
Duolingo-15|Vaughan on group in the central american country of guatemala. 
Duolingo-16|The company said he had to travel to neighboring el salvador. 
Duolingo-17|For an english test while applying to universities in the united states. 
Duolingo-18|With that experience. 
Duolingo-19|He wanted to create a test. 
Duolingo-20|So more students could prove their english ability. 
Duolingo-21|And the duolingo english test. 
Duolingo-22|Det. 
Duolingo-23|Came out in 2016. 
Duolingo-24|Jennifer dewar works for duolingo. 
Duolingo-25|She helps universities around the world. 
Duolingo-26|Understand how the duolingo test. 
Duolingo-27|Can measure students english language skills. 
Duolingo-28|For me when i counter the duolingo english cuz i saw it is as a real. 
Duolingo-29|As a real solution in as a real tool that could democratize access. 
Duolingo-30|To education. 
Duolingo-31|For students around the world. 
Duolingo-32|Dewar said hundreds of universities had already accepted the duolingo test. 
Duolingo-33|Before the covid-19 pandemic. 
Duolingo-34|Closed many testing centers. 
Duolingo-35|Since then. 
Duolingo-36|The number grew to almost 2,000. 
Duolingo-37|Around the world. 
Duolingo-38|The schools included well-known universities like georgetown. 
Duolingo-39|Caltech and yale. 
Duolingo-40|Florida state university in tallahassee florida is one of the schools that is trying out duolingo test. 
Duolingo-41|Patrick kennel is director of the university's center for intensive english studies. 
Duolingo-42|He's excited about the new ideas duolingo brought to english testing. 
Duolingo-43|But he is not sure whether it measures english skills. 
Duolingo-44|As well as the traditional tests. 
Duolingo-45|Is it valid for what it says measures he asked. 
Duolingo-46|He also wondered if students who use their score. 
Duolingo-47|On the det. 
Duolingo-48|To get into a university will have trouble keeping up in the classroom. 
Duolingo-49|Only time will tell he added. 
Duolingo-50|The duolingo test requires students to fill in missing letters. 
Duolingo-51|In groups of words. 
Duolingo-52|Listen and choose whether the word they hear is english or made up. 
Duolingo-53|Write short answers to questions. 
Duolingo-54|And listen to a sentence and write it word for word. 
Duolingo-55|Test-takers are also required. 
Duolingo-56|To speak english into their computer microphone. 
Duolingo-57|About several subjects. 
Duolingo-58|Most questions have a time limit. 
Duolingo-59|And the test. 
Duolingo-60|Which costs $49. 
Duolingo-61|Takes less than one hour to complete. 
Duolingo-62|Because duolingo stats can be taken by a student at home. 
Duolingo-63|Some universities are concerned. 
Duolingo-64|But it might be easy to cheat. 
Duolingo-65|But duolingo says it is always working to make sure that students cannot. 
Duolingo-66|The company also works on security because it does not want a student. 
Duolingo-67|Who got a good score on the det. 
Duolingo-68|To arrive at school. 
Duolingo-69|And not be able to speak english as well as their score showed. 
Duolingo-70|Before the online test starts. 
Duolingo-71|Students must show their identification paper or passport. 
Duolingo-72|And take a photo of themselves. 
Duolingo-73|If the two photos do not look the same. 
Duolingo-74|A reviewer will question the test results. 
Duolingo-75|Since duolingo test is adaptive. 
Duolingo-76|Meaning the next question depends on the answer to the current question. 
Duolingo-77|No one has ever taken the same test as another person. 
Duolingo-78|Boxing bag is duolingo is head of security. 
Duolingo-79|He said. 
Duolingo-80|No matter what testing companies do some people probably cheat. 
Duolingo-81|And do not get caught. 
Duolingo-82|Most universities want students to score close to 120 points on the det. 
Duolingo-83|The top scorers will be around 150. 
Duolingo-84|But even people who grew up speaking english do not always score that high. 
Duolingo-85|Burr settles is one of the test creator that duolingo he said duolingo aims to make its test. 
Duolingo-86|A good simulation of how people speak english in real life. 
Duolingo-87|We want the test to be something that is. 
Duolingo-88|Fun and natural to take. 
Duolingo-89|And at the same time you're better off learning the language than to like learn how to take the test. 
Duolingo-90|In the year ending on july 31st. 
Duolingo-91|2021. 
Duolingo-92|Duolingo said most test-takers came from india china and the us. 
Duolingo-93|Kennel compared the det2 tests that one might give an athlete. 
Duolingo-94|He said. 
Duolingo-95|Just because a soccer player can run fast or kick the ball well. 
Duolingo-96|It does not mean that player will be as good as lionel messi. 
Duolingo-97|The player must understand the game work with teammates and fit into the team's system. 
Duolingo-98|In the same way he said a college student needs to be able to read difficult books. 
Duolingo-99|Listen to lessons. 
Duolingo-100|Write papers enjoying class discussions in english. 
Duolingo-101|The alton toefl kennel said. 
Duolingo-102|Measure those skills better since they simulate what students will do in the university classroom. 
Duolingo-103|Bo benson works with international students who are thinking of coming to northeastern university in boston. 
Duolingo-104|The school has over 10,000 international students each year. 
Duolingo-105|He thinks the duolingo test does a good job. 
Duolingo-106|Of showing that a student can speak english well enough. 
Duolingo-107|To take classes in the us. 
Duolingo-108|We we just need something that we can trust something that's going to be fast. 
Duolingo-109|Something that we don't need to question. 
Duolingo-110|That's not good. 
Duolingo-112|And then duolingo spinners been great in that sense. 
Duolingo-113|Regardless of the acceptance rate for the duolingo english test. 
Duolingo-114|It has already made an impact. 
Duolingo-115|Earlier this year. 
Duolingo-116|Ets the maker of toefl. 
Duolingo-117|Launch the shorter less-costly test. 
Duolingo-118|Called toefl essentials. 
Duolingo-119|Florida state's kennel however. 
Duolingo-120|Horned that no english test is perfect. 
Duolingo-122|Definitely. 
Duolingo-125|I can't do it. 
Duolingo-126|English test. 
Duolingo-127|Alcohol package. 
Duolingo-128|I'm dan friedel. 
ESL-1|Students in english as a second language. 
ESL-2|Or eso. 
ESL-3|Programs are a large and growing population in american schools. 
ESL-4|The us department of education says that the number of esl learners. 
ESL-5|Increased by more than 1 million. 
ESL-6|From 2000 to 2020. 
ESL-7|That is about 10% of all students in the country. 
ESL-8|In states like california and texas. 
ESL-9|Nearly 20% of students are english learners. 
ESL-10|But english learners are everywhere in the country. 
ESL-11|Notes leslie villegas. 
ESL-12|She is an education researcher with the new america foundation in washington dc. 
ESL-13|Her recent study looked at the percentage of esl students. 
ESL-14|Within each state. 
ESL-15|As well as the most common languages spoken at home for those students. 
ESL-16|As the number of english learners grow. 
ESL-17|There is a need for more esl teachers. 
ESL-18|But the us is dealing with a nationwide teacher shortage across all grade and subject areas. 
ESL-19|And in the next few years. 
ESL-20|Experts expect the shortage to get worse among english-language educators. 
ESL-21|Diego said. 
ESL-22|Josie gutierrez is the assistant superintendent of the waco independent school district. 
ESL-23|In texas. 
ESL-24|She said the teacher shortage has slowed down the growth of the district's bilingual program. 
ESL-25|There has been an increase in state and federal pandemic aid to schools. 
ESL-26|So money is not the problem gutierrez noted. 
ESL-27|But the supply of teachers has not increased. 
ESL-28|And schools are vying for the same supply she said. 
ESL-29|School district know that esl teachers are often in short supply. 
ESL-30|District leaders often try to improve and increase their recruiting efforts. 
ESL-31|Grace benson is the director of esl and bilingual education. 
ESL-32|Of waco schools. 
ESL-33|She said being an eso and bilingual education. 
ESL-34|I am always recruiting. 
ESL-35|Even when we're not in a pandemic. 
ESL-36|Just because bilingual education as a whole is under a shortage. 
ESL-37|Benson said she has been able to fill almost all esl positions. 
ESL-38|For the school year. 
ESL-39|In austin texas. 
ESL-40|The city school district requires all elementary school teachers. 
ESL-41|As well as middle and high school english teachers. 
ESL-42|To be trained in eso instruction. 
ESL-43|Assistant superintendent destiny edwards. 
ESL-44|Said that is a large reason why there is currently no shortage of esl teachers in austin. 
ESL-45|Where more than 27% of the city's 75,000 students. 
ESL-46|Are learning english. 
ESL-47|Jackie leroy is head of esl programs for syracuse city school district in new york. 
ESL-48|She said when she started working there 22 years ago. 
ESL-49|5% of students were esl learners. 
ESL-50|No more than 18% of the city's students are english learners. 
ESL-51|She said that even though job applications have slowed lately. 
ESL-52|The city has been very active in recruiting teachers. 
ESL-53|She also said many students that have gone through syracuse's esl program. 
ESL-54|Later returned as teachers. 
ESL-55|English learners are among the students who have struggled the most during the pandemic. 
ESL-56|School district officials say. 
ESL-57|Edwards with austin schools. 
ESL-58|Said a large percentage of the city's esl students. 
ESL-59|We're not faring well during the early part of the pandemic. 
ESL-60|A larger percent had failing grades she said. 
ESL-61|Learning and studying in a home where english was not the main language spoken. 
ESL-62|Proved to be very hard for many students. 
ESL-63|Some parents of esl students had difficulty communicating with teachers. 
ESL-64|And understanding what learning materials their children needed. 
ESL-65|If they're in their home the whole time. 
ESL-66|And there's no one that speaks english. 
ESL-67|And all their assignments are in english. 
ESL-68|How do they get that extra support. 
ESL-69|Leroy said. 
ESL-70|Edwards said esl students in austin. 
ESL-71|Have greatly benefited from the return to in-person classes. 
ESL-72|Students are now able to have a full day of classes. 
ESL-73|And the district has started providing small group instruction. 
ESL-74|But it is largely unknown how many students are behind in their english and academic progress. 
ESL-75|Said the researcher villegas. 
ESL-76|There is not enough data to know for sure. 
ESL-77|In texas for example. 
ESL-78|There was a statewide tests to measure performance. 
ESL-79|But the test was not required for all students. 
ESL-80|English learners many of whom come from immigrant families. 
ESL-81|Also faced difficulties at home. 
ESL-82|In texas some immigrant families were unable to receive pandemic aid. 
ESL-83|And feared looking for health insurance. 
ESL-84|Because they are undocumented. 
ESL-85|Benson said. 
ESL-86|Some students needed to get jobs. 
ESL-87|To provide extra money for their families. 
ESL-88|The pandemic as a whole. 
ESL-89|Has added so many challenges benson said. 
ESL-90|But they face additional challenges. 
ESL-91|That are out of their control. 
ESL-92|I'm getting over.

Electric_Vehicle-29|He said more and more people would buy evs. 
Electric_Vehicle-30|Notwithstanding the cost of the battery in sevilla called. 
Electric_Vehicle-31|This increasing battery costs could be an unusual short-term change. 
Electric_Vehicle-32|In a situation in which improving technology and growing production has pushed costs down for almost 30 years. 
Electric_Vehicle-33|Industry data showed that the $105 per kilowatt-hour average cost in 2021 was down nearly 99% from over $7,500 in 1991. 
Electric_Vehicle-34|Experts say battery costs could stay high for the next year or so. 
Electric_Vehicle-35|But then another large drop is likely as big investments by automakers and suppliers change the balance from shortage to surplus. 
Electric_Vehicle-36|It's like a bubble and for that bubble to settle down it's going to be at least the end of 2023.

Electric_Vehicle-40|As a signal v's we're reaching a similar cost to fossil fuel vehicles. 
Electric_Vehicle-41|But with gasoline prices high and consumer preferences changing. 
Electric_Vehicle-42|Search cost considerations may no longer matter as much experts say. 
Electric_Vehicle-43|Pv demand in china and other markets. 
Electric_Vehicle-44|Is going up faster than people thought.

Emotional_Night-1|It was an unforgettable oscar night. 
Emotional_Night-2|On sunday in los angeles. 
Emotional_Night-3|Poor actor will smith. 
Emotional_Night-4|Smith won the academy award for best actor. 
Emotional_Night-5|For his performance in king richard. 
Emotional_Night-6|Only a few minutes earlier. 
Emotional_Night-7|Smith had walked up to the stage. 
Emotional_Night-8|And hip presenter chris rock. 
Emotional_Night-9|In the face. 
Emotional_Night-10|With his open hand. 
Emotional_Night-11|Smith reacted after rock made a joke about smith's wife. 
Emotional_Night-12|Jada pinkett smith. 
Emotional_Night-13|People in the audience and television viewers around the world. 
Emotional_Night-14|We're shocked. 
Emotional_Night-15|To see the dispute between. 
Emotional_Night-16|Two well-known performers. 
Emotional_Night-17|On hollywood's biggest night. 
Emotional_Night-18|Rocks joke related. 
Emotional_Night-19|To pinkett smith's. 
Emotional_Night-20|Hairless head. 
Emotional_Night-21|Pinkett-smith has a medical condition. 
Emotional_Night-22|Side effects hair growth. 
Emotional_Night-23|Rock said. 
Emotional_Night-24|Jada. 
Emotional_Night-25|I love you. 
Emotional_Night-26|G.i. jane too can't wait to see it. 
Emotional_Night-27|He meant that pinkett-smith looked like she was preparing to star in the second g.i. jane film. 
Emotional_Night-28|The 1997 film was about a woman who enters the military and cuts off her long hair. 
Emotional_Night-29|After smith hit rocks face. 
Emotional_Night-30|He walked back to his seat. 
Emotional_Night-31|He then shouted at rock. 
Emotional_Night-32|2. 
Emotional_Night-33|Keep my wife's name. 
Emotional_Night-34|Ouch or blank. 
Emotional_Night-35|Mouse. 
Emotional_Night-36|His yelling included a bad word. 
Emotional_Night-37|In the united states television viewers did not hear the sound. 
Emotional_Night-38|During the dispute. 
Emotional_Night-39|The broadcaster had turned off the sound because of bad language. 
Emotional_Night-40|Viewers in other parts of the world. 
Emotional_Night-41|Heard the full exchange. 
Emotional_Night-42|The television broadcast went to an advertisement. 
Emotional_Night-43|Actors daniel kaluuya denzel washington and tyler perry. 
Emotional_Night-44|Talked with smith and calmed the situation. 
Emotional_Night-45|Not long after smith came back to the stage to accept his first oscar for best actor. 
Emotional_Night-46|He used his acceptance speech to apologize for his earlier actions. 
Emotional_Night-47|In king richard. 
Emotional_Night-48|Smith played richard williams. 
Emotional_Night-49|The father of american tennis player is venus and serena williams. 
Emotional_Night-50|Smith said in his speech that he. 
Emotional_Night-51|Like williams. 
Emotional_Night-52|Was a fierce defender of his family. 
Emotional_Night-53|He explained that he was trying to protect his wife from insult. 
Emotional_Night-54|Smith added that famous people usually have to take abuse. 
Emotional_Night-55|Smile. 
Emotional_Night-56|And pretend like that's okay. 
Emotional_Night-57|Smith apologized to the organizers of the oscars but he did not apologize directly to rock. 
Emotional_Night-58|He later said that denzel washington told him. 
Emotional_Night-59|At your highest moment be careful. 
Emotional_Night-60|Because that's when the devil comes for you. 
Emotional_Night-61|The organization that runs the oscars is the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences. 
Emotional_Night-62|The group said it was against violence of any form. 
Emotional_Night-63|Brock did not comment on the incident. 
Emotional_Night-64|Later the los angeles police department said rock had no plans to take legal action against smith. 
Emotional_Night-65|The situation became the biggest story of the night rising past the story of smith's. 
Emotional_Night-66|Best actor award. 
Emotional_Night-67|And the historic win for coda. 
Emotional_Night-68|It became the first film from a streaming media service. 
Emotional_Night-69|To win best picture.

Even_Mild_COVID_19-1|A new study provides additional evidence. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-2|That covid-19 can damage parts of the brain. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-3|The study said that even people with mild sickness can suffer brain tissue shrinkage. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-4|And damage to areas that control smell. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-5|The research was led by scientists at britain's oxford university. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-6|The researchers said their study provides strong evidence of brain related abnormalities in covid-19. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-7|The team noted that past studies have also found links between covid-19. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-8|And changes to the brain. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-9|But those studies centered mainly on covid-19 patients who are hospitalized with severe sickness. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-10|The latest study recently appeared in the publication nature. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-11|The team said further study is needed. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-12|To find out whether the brain changes are long-lasting. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-13|And can be fixed. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-14|The study involved 785 subjects in britain. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-15|Between the ages of 51 and 81. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-16|All were given to brain scans to measure differences during the experiment. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-17|A total of 401 subjects were found to be infected with covid-19 between the scans. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-18|Most of them had only minor sickness. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-19|The researchers reported a number of brain affects in the patients. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-20|The subjects experienced the effects on average. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-21|Four-and-a-half months after infection. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-22|The changes included a greater reduction in gray matter thickness. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-23|After individuals were infected with covid-19. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-24|Gray matter in the brain helps people control movement memory and emotions. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-25|The greatest reduction was seen in areas of the brain. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-26|Linked to smell. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-27|In addition some infected patients also showed a reduction in whole brain size. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-28|The researchers reported. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-29|On average subjects infected with covid-19. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-30|Also showed greater cognitive decline linked to an area of the brain related to cognition. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-31|When i add 20 is a professor at oxford and the lead writer of the study. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-32|She said in a statement that losses in gray matter and the tissue damage in infected individuals. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-33|Led to a reduction in their abilities to perform complex tasks. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-34|All these negative effects were more marked at older ages. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-35|Dual noted. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-36|A key question for future brain imaging studies. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-37|Is to see if this brain tissue damage resolves over the longer-term. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-38|She added. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-39|The study was carried out when the alpha version of covid-19 was widespread in britain. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-40|Past studies have found that some covid-19 patients suffered from brain fog. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-41|Or a lack of mental clarity. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-42|The condition can cause memory problems and reduce a person's ability to be attentive. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-43|Concentrate. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-44|And process information normally. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-45|The researchers did not say whether vaccination against covid-19 had any influence on the brain changes. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-46|But the uk health security agency released findings on the issue last month. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-47|The agency said an examination of 15 studies. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-48|Found that vaccinated people. 
Even_Mild_COVID_19-49|We're about half as likely to suffer long-term effects of covid-19.

Experts_Discuss-1|More than two years into the covid-19 pandemic. 
Experts_Discuss-2|United states health officials are discussing how to best protect americans from the ever-changing coronavirus. 
Experts_Discuss-3|On wednesday a group of vaccine advisers to the food and drug administration. 
Experts_Discuss-4|Spent hours debating questions about changing vaccine shots and doing future booster campaigns. 
Experts_Discuss-5|They did not reach any exact decisions. 
Experts_Discuss-6|The questions facing the experts included. 
Experts_Discuss-7|How often should vaccines be updated against new strains. 
Experts_Discuss-8|How effective should vaccines be to get government approval. 
Experts_Discuss-9|Should vaccine updates be coordinated with international health authorities. 
Experts_Discuss-10|The fda recently approved a fourth shot of the pfizer or moderna vaccines. 
Experts_Discuss-11|For anyone 50 or older. 
Experts_Discuss-12|And for some younger people with severely weakened immune systems. 
Experts_Discuss-13|The move is part of an effort to get ahead of another possible surge. 
Experts_Discuss-14|But the fda's vaccine chief. 
Experts_Discuss-15|Dr. peter marks said at the meeting. 
Experts_Discuss-16|We simply can't be boosting people as frequently as we are. 
Experts_Discuss-17|He called the latest booster update. 
Experts_Discuss-18|A temporary measure. 
Experts_Discuss-19|To protect americans. 
Experts_Discuss-20|While government officials decide whether and how to change current vaccines. 
Experts_Discuss-21|Mark's cautioned that reduced vaccine protection new variants and colder weather in the autumn. 
Experts_Discuss-22|Could raise the risk of more searches. 
Experts_Discuss-23|One area where experts appeared to agree is that vaccines should be judged on their ability to prevent severe disease that leads to hospitalization and steph. 
Experts_Discuss-24|Dr. mark sawyer of the university of california san diego said. 
Experts_Discuss-25|We need to focus on the worst case. 
Experts_Discuss-26|Which is severe disease. 
Experts_Discuss-27|By that measure the current vaccines has held up well. 
Experts_Discuss-28|During the last omicron driven search. 
Experts_Discuss-29|2 vaccine doses were nearly 80% effective against needing a breathing machine or death. 
Experts_Discuss-30|And the booster pushed that protection to 94%. 
Experts_Discuss-31|Federal scientists recently reported. 
Experts_Discuss-32|But only about half of americans eligible for a third shot have gotten one. 
Experts_Discuss-33|And many experts say it was not the best idea. 
Experts_Discuss-34|To continue asking americans to get boosted every few months. 
Experts_Discuss-35|An expert from the centers for disease control and prevention. 
Experts_Discuss-36|Suggested that the 80% protection from severe disease. 
Experts_Discuss-37|Could become the standard for vaccines. 
Experts_Discuss-38|I think we may have to accept that level of protection. 
Experts_Discuss-39|Infant use other methods. 
Experts_Discuss-40|Said dr. amanda cohn. 
Experts_Discuss-41|Cdc's chief medical officer. 
Experts_Discuss-42|Presentations at the meeting by government health officials and independent researchers. 
Experts_Discuss-43|Explored the difficulty of predicting when the next major covid-19 variant might appear. 
Experts_Discuss-44|Trevor bedford of the fred hutchinson cancer research center. 
Experts_Discuss-45|Said a major new strain like omicron could arrive anywhere from everyone point five years. 
Experts_Discuss-46|To once a decade. 
Experts_Discuss-47|Based on current data. 
Experts_Discuss-48|All three covid-19 vaccine is now used in the us. 
Experts_Discuss-49|Are based on the original coronavirus that appeared in late 2019. 
Experts_Discuss-50|Updating the vaccines will be a difficult job. 
Experts_Discuss-51|Likely requiring communication between the fda manufacturers. 
Experts_Discuss-52|And international health authorities. 
Experts_Discuss-53|To get the vaccines to market quickly. 
Experts_Discuss-54|The fda used shorter ways to judge effectiveness. 
Experts_Discuss-55|Mainly looking at the early vaccine effects on the immune system's antibody levels. 
Experts_Discuss-56|A number of experts said they wanted better data from studies that follow patients over time to see who gets sick or dies. 
Experts_Discuss-57|But that approach would likely take too much time. 
Experts_Discuss-58|Dr. offer levi of harvard medical school's head. 
Experts_Discuss-59|It's going to be hard to generate all the data we want in short order when a new variant emerges. 
Experts_Discuss-60|Robert johnson. 
Experts_Discuss-61|A representative for the us biomedical advanced research and development authority. 
Experts_Discuss-62|Barda. 
Experts_Discuss-63|Describe this small amount of time that manufacturers. 
Experts_Discuss-64|Could have to remake study. 
Experts_Discuss-65|And mass-produce an updated vaccine by september. 
Experts_Discuss-66|If you are not on your way to a clinical trial by the beginning of may. 
Experts_Discuss-67|I think it's going to be very difficult. 
Experts_Discuss-68|Do you have enough product across manufacturers. 
Experts_Discuss-69|To meet demand he said. 
Experts_Discuss-70|The process for updating yearly flu vaccines offers a possible plan. 
Experts_Discuss-71|As laid out by a representative from the world health organization. 
Experts_Discuss-72|Twice-a-year whio experts recommend updates to flu vaccines. 
Experts_Discuss-73|To target new strains. 
Experts_Discuss-74|The fda then brings those recommendations. 
Experts_Discuss-75|To its own vaccine panel. 
Experts_Discuss-76|Which votes on whether they make sense for the u.s.. 
Experts_Discuss-77|But covid-19 has not yet fallen into a predictable pattern like the flu. 
Experts_Discuss-78|And as the coronavirus evolves. 
Experts_Discuss-79|Different strains may become stronger in different parts of the world. 
Experts_Discuss-80|Several experts said they would need more meetings with more data and proposals from the fda to decide on a plan. 
Experts_Discuss-81|Who better fuller of the university of michigan's medical school said. 
Experts_Discuss-82|We've never been here before. 
Experts_Discuss-83|We're all working together to do the best we can and it's very complex. 
Experts_Discuss-84|I'm john russell. 
Experts_Discuss-85|And i'm mario ritter junior. 
Experts_Give_Advice-1|Students have until the end of april to tell the universities that have accepted them. 
Experts_Give_Advice-2|If they will attend. 
Experts_Give_Advice-3|Most students found out if they were accepted in late march. 
Experts_Give_Advice-4|Some students are accepted by their top choice school and immediately decide they will attend it. 
Experts_Give_Advice-5|Others get rejections and must choose another school. 
Experts_Give_Advice-6|Still others are placed on a waiting list and might not find out if they are accepted to their top choice until the summer. 
Experts_Give_Advice-7|After all the studying tests and applications. 
Experts_Give_Advice-8|Students are usually happy to be accepted by several schools. 
Experts_Give_Advice-9|But choosing a college is not easy. 
Experts_Give_Advice-10|This year the decision might be more difficult than ever. 
Experts_Give_Advice-11|Colleges and universities around the us are reporting much lower acceptance rates. 
Experts_Give_Advice-12|That includes rice university in houston. 
Experts_Give_Advice-13|Notre dame university in indiana the university of southern california and both. 
Experts_Give_Advice-14|Brown university and harvard university of the ivy league. 
Experts_Give_Advice-15|Voa spoke with two experts who explained why the rates are so low. 
Experts_Give_Advice-16|Because of the covid-19 pandemic. 
Experts_Give_Advice-17|Many students delayed college they said. 
Experts_Give_Advice-18|In addition thousands of universities decided not to require standardized tests. 
Experts_Give_Advice-19|As a result this year university has received many more applications than usual. 
Experts_Give_Advice-20|And have fewer places for students who are finishing high school this year. 
Experts_Give_Advice-21|Nicole porcaro runs no anxiety prep. 
Experts_Give_Advice-22|An educational advising company near washington dc. 
Experts_Give_Advice-23|A lot of students who in previous years thought they were shoo-ins for certain schools. 
Experts_Give_Advice-24|Have not been accepted she said. 
Experts_Give_Advice-25|Toquero said some students she works with are now deciding between their second choice schools. 
Experts_Give_Advice-26|I encourage them to try to understand which is really hard at that age that plans and dreams chain. 
Experts_Give_Advice-27|And it may seem that you are one hundred percent locked into a school or a major or a plan and. 
Experts_Give_Advice-28|It changes. 
Experts_Give_Advice-29|Alex kupe isn't advisor for a company called empowerly based in san francisco california. 
Experts_Give_Advice-30|In the past he was an admissions counselor at stanford. 
Experts_Give_Advice-31|He said some students feel stuck. 
Experts_Give_Advice-32|Rice a highly rated school in houston texas accept it only 2,000. 
Experts_Give_Advice-33|691 students. 
Experts_Give_Advice-34|Out of over 31,000 to applied. 
Experts_Give_Advice-35|Yvonne romero dasilva. 
Experts_Give_Advice-36|Is the school's vice president for enrollment. 
Experts_Give_Advice-37|Romero dasilva said students deciding between more than one college. 
Experts_Give_Advice-38|Should think about the one they feel most connected to. 
Experts_Give_Advice-39|Even if it is not the one with the highest rank. 
Experts_Give_Advice-40|Institution has a unique. 
Experts_Give_Advice-41|Element to it culture to it. 
Experts_Give_Advice-42|So i feel sad sometimes for the students who felt forced to make that decision of where they're going to go simply because the school was ranked. 
Experts_Give_Advice-43|Higher than the school that they really really loved. 
Experts_Give_Advice-44|Ramiro dasilva said many parents can get caught up in a schools rank. 
Experts_Give_Advice-45|But the important thing for them to do is help their children. 
Experts_Give_Advice-46|Get excited about going to a school where they will thrive or too well. 
Experts_Give_Advice-47|This year many universities opened their campuses to visitors. 
Experts_Give_Advice-48|And are not closed because of covid-19 restrictions. 
Experts_Give_Advice-49|So romero de silva said she believes high school students who went to events for. 
Experts_Give_Advice-50|Prospective students. 
Experts_Give_Advice-51|Will have an easier time deciding if they want to attend the school. 
Experts_Give_Advice-52|Rice hosted its event for visitors known as owl days recently. 
Experts_Give_Advice-53|Rice's campus is so beautiful. 
Experts_Give_Advice-54|You just can't get a sense of the physical spaces. 
Experts_Give_Advice-55|Until you're actually here romero de silva said. 
Experts_Give_Advice-56|Many universities offer more chances for students to visit before requiring a decision. 
Experts_Give_Advice-57|The experts said this is extra helpful for graduate students. 
Experts_Give_Advice-58|They may be able to visit a laboratory or to meet with the professor who will guide their studies. 
Experts_Give_Advice-59|Kupe said one of his jobs during this time of year. 
Experts_Give_Advice-60|Is to remind students. 
Experts_Give_Advice-61|That they put a lot of work into choosing schools. 
Experts_Give_Advice-62|Over a year ago when making applications. 
Experts_Give_Advice-63|I become kind of a mirror to help reflect these things the students said were important to pay said. 
Experts_Give_Advice-64|Both copay and porcaro said it is unlikely. 
Experts_Give_Advice-65|Especially this year. 
Experts_Give_Advice-66|That students will be accepted from waiting list. 
Experts_Give_Advice-67|But they should accept a place on the waiting list quickly. 
Experts_Give_Advice-68|The next step is to contact the school. 
Experts_Give_Advice-69|And express interest for a second time. 
Experts_Give_Advice-70|This is called a letter of continued interest. 
Experts_Give_Advice-71|The document should include any new information about the student. 
Experts_Give_Advice-72|The new information does not have to be curing cancer porcaro said. 
Experts_Give_Advice-73|But as long as they can show they've been using their time well and not coasting. 
Experts_Give_Advice-74|The next thing students should do is send in money to hold their place at another school who pay said. 
Experts_Give_Advice-75|This is called a deposit. 
Experts_Give_Advice-76|They may lose the money if a spot at their first-choice school open. 
Experts_Give_Advice-77|But the peace of mind is precious at this stage he said. 
Experts_Give_Advice-78|As the year goes on sunday short update. 
Experts_Give_Advice-79|Every 3 to 4 weeks cooper gadot. 
Experts_Give_Advice-80|Porcaro said there is a lot of information available for international students. 
Experts_Give_Advice-81|They should attend as many computer-based activities as possible. 
Experts_Give_Advice-82|She also discussed a company called college scoops. 
Experts_Give_Advice-83|Set presents independent visits to college campuses. 
Experts_Give_Advice-84|Kupe said international students who are on a waitlist. 
Experts_Give_Advice-85|Should use two strategies. 
Experts_Give_Advice-86|Tell the university that they do not need financial aid. 
Experts_Give_Advice-87|And consider centering their studies on a different subject. 
Experts_Give_Advice-88|The subject that can always be changed later. 
Experts_Give_Advice-89|After all. 
Experts_Give_Advice-90|Many american students do it. 
Experts_Give_Advice-91|On the first day of college back to buy elegy. 
Experts_Give_Advice-92|Didn't change their mind here all the time.

Face_Covering-1|Major school districts around the united states. 
Face_Covering-2|Are permitting students to attend class. 
Face_Covering-3|Without face coverings. 
Face_Covering-4|For the first time in nearly two years. 
Face_Covering-5|The rules relating to face coverings. 
Face_Covering-6|Or masks. 
Face_Covering-7|Have caused fights among educators. 
Face_Covering-8|School boards. 
Face_Covering-9|And parents. 
Face_Covering-10|Throughout the covid-19 pandemic. 
Face_Covering-11|New york city is the largest school district in the country. 
Face_Covering-12|It ended its mask requirement on march 7th. 
Face_Covering-13|Philadelphia lifted its school mask requirements on march 9th. 
Face_Covering-14|It's joined other big cities such as houston and dallas. 
Face_Covering-15|That made similar moves in the past week. 
Face_Covering-16|Chicago schools ended their mask requirement monday. 
Face_Covering-17|Parents teachers and school leaders. 
Face_Covering-18|Almost balance the new rules. 
Face_Covering-19|Some families are happy that their children no longer have to wear masks. 
Face_Covering-20|But others say they are still worried. 
Face_Covering-21|And are urging their children to continue wearing face coverings for now. 
Face_Covering-22|Educators are caught in the middle. 
Face_Covering-23|In anchorage alaska top school official dina bishop. 
Face_Covering-24|Says lifting the mandate in the city's nearly 100 public schools. 
Face_Covering-25|Was a welcome change. 
Face_Covering-26|She said they were months of arguments over mess. 
Face_Covering-27|So i'm glad that we've taken that fight away. 
Face_Covering-28|And now we can go back to focus on learning bishop said. 
Face_Covering-29|Calling covid-19 infection rate and new federal health recommendations. 
Face_Covering-30|Are leading states to drop the requirements. 
Face_Covering-31|The centers for disease control and prevention. 
Face_Covering-32|Recently issued new guidelines. 
Face_Covering-33|Saying most healthy americans including students. 
Face_Covering-34|Can safely stop wearing masks. 
Face_Covering-35|But those who disagree about ending school mask requirements. 
Face_Covering-36|Often points to low vaccination rates among american children. 
Face_Covering-37|Only about 25% of children ages 5 to 11. 
Face_Covering-38|Have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. 
Face_Covering-39|Just 58% of children ages 12 to 17. 
Face_Covering-40|Are vaccinated. 
Face_Covering-41|The cdc says. 
Face_Covering-42|New york connecticut massachusetts illinois and delaware. 
Face_Covering-43|Recently lifted their statewide school mask requirements. 
Face_Covering-44|New jersey and rhode island. 
Face_Covering-45|Officially dropped there's last monday. 
Face_Covering-46|California oregon and washington. 
Face_Covering-47|All dropped their statewide mandates on march 12th. 
Face_Covering-48|In many places the decisions are being made at the local school district level. 
Face_Covering-49|Officials in many large cities such as boston los angeles and washington dc. 
Face_Covering-50|Have said they will keep mask rules for now. 
Face_Covering-51|Officials say that could change if vaccination rates rise among their students. 
Face_Covering-52|Or if they can reach agreements with teachers unions. 
Face_Covering-53|Unions have been strong supporters of keeping the mask requirements in place. 
Face_Covering-54|Chicago schools announced last week that masks will no longer be required starting march 14th. 
Face_Covering-55|The city's teachers union then promised to take officials to court. 
Face_Covering-56|They said the move will break an agreement with the district. 
Face_Covering-57|To keep the mask rule through the end of the school year. 
Face_Covering-58|In new york city. 
Face_Covering-59|Elementary school student jack jalali. 
Face_Covering-60|Stopped wearing his mask when they became optional. 
Face_Covering-61|For children it's really great because you can see the way words are pronounced. 
Face_Covering-62|If you can see spelling. 
Face_Covering-63|Said jack's mother andrea. 
Face_Covering-64|But third grade student derrick carter jacob. 
Face_Covering-65|Kept his mask on. 
Face_Covering-66|Even after new york removed the requirement. 
Face_Covering-67|Leave it on. 
Face_Covering-68|There's no reason for him to take it off. 
Face_Covering-69|Until basically everybody is safe. 
Face_Covering-70|Said his parents michael jacob. 
Face_Covering-71|John bracy is a latin teacher at belmont high school. 
Face_Covering-72|Near boston massachusetts. 
Face_Covering-73|He said he will keep wearing his mask through the end of the academic year. 
Face_Covering-74|Even if district officials decided to end the man days. 
Face_Covering-75|I have major concerns on so many levels. 
Face_Covering-76|Tracy said. 
Face_Covering-77|I just can't find a public health or moral justification. 
Face_Covering-78|For removing them. 
Face_Covering-79|Melissa bello is a parent in needham massachusetts. 
Face_Covering-80|Outside boston. 
Face_Covering-81|She said her two children were among those. 
Face_Covering-82|Who happily removed their masks last week. 
Face_Covering-83|She said her eight-year-old son has hearing loss. 
Face_Covering-84|And has had trouble understanding what people are saying when they wear masks. 
Face_Covering-85|He's working harder every day in school. 
Face_Covering-86|And coming home more tired bello said. 
Face_Covering-87|There is not enough consideration for those kinds of trade-offs. 
Face_Covering-88|In these mask mandates. 
Face_Covering-89|I'm doing over. 
Facial_Recognit-1|big technology companies like Amazon have said they are limiting their sale of facial recognition software to law enforcement agencies
Facial_Recognit-2|Clearview AI has not
Facial_Recognit-3|it is a private company based in New York City
Facial_Recognit-4|Clearview AI provides a facial recognition search engine that contains 3 billion images taken from the internet
Facial_Recognit-5|the search engine identifies images of people's faces
Facial_Recognit-6|the company says more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies use the software
Facial_Recognit-7|wonton tap is the chief executive and co-founder of the company
Facial_Recognit-8|he said the way it works is very similar to Google
Facial_Recognit-9|but instead of putting in words
Facial_Recognit-10|you're pudding and photos of faces
Facial_Recognit-11|and it will find anything publicly available on the internet that looks like that face
Facial_Recognit-12|police say facial recognition software is an important tool in fighting and solving crimes
Facial_Recognit-13|but it's increasing use as raised concerns that there are too few rules and plays for when and how police can use it
Facial_Recognit-14|police usually have image search engines which can look at driver's license pictures or other images among police records
Facial_Recognit-15|Clearview AI has billions of images gathered from social media and other sites
Facial_Recognit-16|internet companies have said the images were taken by breaking their rules
Facial_Recognit-17|however Clearview AI Staunton said that the company only takes publicly available information
Facial_Recognit-18|Clearview AI describes a case on its website in which federal agents were able to identify a man suspected of sexual abuse of a girl from one image using a search engine
Facial_Recognit-19|contact said the software has also been used to identify suspects who stormed the US Capitol in January
Facial_Recognit-20|he said Clearview AI was useful in the investigation of many people who may not have had pictures in police databases
Facial_Recognit-21|a search using Clearview AI search engine takes about 1 second
Facial_Recognit-22|contact said police were able to quickly identify the suspects from the January 6th incident
Facial_Recognit-23|they could also reduce false results
Facial_Recognit-24|and speed up the investigation process
Facial_Recognit-25|when protests against police methods happened in the United States last year
Facial_Recognit-26|Amazon and some other companies band sales of facial recognition technology to law enforcement
Facial_Recognit-27|they have not said when they will restart
Facial_Recognit-28|Clearview AI continues to provide services to law enforcement agencies
Facial_Recognit-29|internet companies like Facebook Google and Twitter and civil rights activist
Facial_Recognit-30|are warning about its power and possible abuse of people's privacy
Facial_Recognit-31|the American civil liberties Union or ACLU is a nonprofit Rights group
Facial_Recognit-32|it has brought legal action against Clearview AI in Chicago and in California
Facial_Recognit-33|Kate ruane is a lawyer for the ACLU
Facial_Recognit-34|she said facial recognition technology makes it possible for the government to watch every part of citizens lives
Facial_Recognit-35|federal state and local governments she said do admit they use it but they don't tell us how when or how often
Facial_Recognit-36|she said there needs to be more laws and supervision
Facial_Recognit-37|she is calling for a total freeze on the technology until then
Facial_Recognit-38|in recent months
Facial_Recognit-39|lawmakers have introduced bills that would limit Police use of data they buy that is illegally obtained
Facial_Recognit-40|Dante that agrees that there needs to be more openness and even rules for the Technologies use
Facial_Recognit-41|but he does not think it should be banned for police use
Facial_Recognit-42|he said it has been successful in solving crimes
Facial_Recognit-43|contact also says that people who use the system must agree to observe its rules
Facial_Recognit-44|he said messages that appear in the software help prevent its misuse
Facial_Recognit-45|the ACLU and other civil rights groups also say they are concerned about what could happen if governments like China have the technology
Facial_Recognit-46|contact said his company does not sell it software to foreign governments
Facial_Recognit-47|he mainly serves law enforcement agencies in the US
Facial_Recognit-48|contact said the company has worked with some private organizations for investigative purposes
Facial_Recognit-49|but they have decided to stay with law enforcement
Facial_Recognit-50|he said it's the easiest most explainable and best use case of our technology

Florida_Universities-38|Tanard said when he was younger he had a different idea about the big florida schools. 
Florida_Universities-39|I grew up thinking of a place like university of florida a school that's really good at football and probably really good at partying but not necessarily the best in terms of academics. 
Florida_Universities-40|Welcome to find out that's that's not the truth.

Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-1|There is a long tradition in the african nation of ghana. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-2|Of local artists painting movie posters. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-3|To advertise films. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-4|But as interest in local movie theaters continues to drop. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-5|Daniel and nam jasper has found success selling his posters. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-6|In other countries. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-7|Jasper recently spoke with reporters from reuters. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-8|From his studio workspace in a cry. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-9|He presented one of his current works. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-10|Showing actor paul newman holding a pair of guns in a poster for the 1969 movie. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-11|Butch cassidy and the sundance kid. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-12|He also showed unfinished paintings that included actors john travolta and bruce lee. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-13|Jasper was one of the country's first movie poster designers. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-14|And has been doing the job for 30 years. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-15|From the late 1970s through the 1990s. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-16|Ghana developed a tradition of advertising films with colorful and descriptive. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-17|Hand-painted posters. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-18|During that. local movie theaters were extremely popular throughout the country. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-19|Artist competed over who could bring in the most people with their imaginative. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-20|And often violent designs. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-21|But over the years the market for jasper's work. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-22|Has greatly changed. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-23|With the rise of the internet. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-24|Ghana's independence theaters began to disappear. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-25|People are no longer interested in going out to watch a movie when it can be watched from the comfort of their phones. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-26|Jasper said. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-27|But there is a growing interest in owning these hand-painted posters internationally. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-28|He added. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-29|Now they hang them in private rooms or show them in exhibitions. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-30|One market where jasper's work has gained appeal is the united states. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-31|Where the posters are valued as unusual representations of a specific. in african art. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-32|Westerns and action movies were traditionally popular. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-33|Azwer bollywood and chinese films. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-34|Many of the posters included supernatural elements and extreme violence. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-35|Even if the film's had none. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-36|And physical details of the actors were often exaggerated. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-37|Joseph arturo frimpong is a pop culture expert and professor at ghana's asha c university. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-38|He has been collecting movie posters for years. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-39|And owns several of jasper's paintings. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-40|He plans to show his posters at the center for african popular culture. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-41|When it opens at the university later this year. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-42|He said he hopes people will realize the historical importance of the posters. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-43|Of course there is an aesthetic value to the posters. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-44|How crazy it is and all of that. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-45|Adora frimpong said. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-46|But we use them to have a conversation with students. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-47|We tell them not to think about what they're saying now. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-48|But to think of these art forms as symbols of history. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-49|That can tell their own stories. 
Ghana_Artist_Finds_New_Market-50|I'm brian lynn. 
Ghanaian_Artist-1|A canadian man who once made jewelry from glass beads is now using old glass to make new art. 
Ghanaian_Artist-2|He hopes to reduce glass waste. 
Ghanaian_Artist-3|And help the environment in his country. 
Ghanaian_Artist-4|If glass artist michael tatar can earn some money doing it. 
Ghanaian_Artist-5|He will be happy to. 
Ghanaian_Artist-6|To taylor and the art of glass blowing during a visit to europe. 
Ghanaian_Artist-7|Yan 2012. 
Ghanaian_Artist-8|He went to see people who knew about glassblowing in the netherlands and france. 
Ghanaian_Artist-9|And learned to make many colored artistic flower holders or water carriers. 
Ghanaian_Artist-10|Many years later today has his own workplace. 
Ghanaian_Artist-11|Where he melts broken glass from waste centers in across and turns it into art. 
Ghanaian_Artist-12|He looks for broken glass from old televisions or bottles. 
Ghanaian_Artist-13|And melt it down in a large round container known as a kiln. 
Ghanaian_Artist-14|The kiln gets very hot nearly 1,500 degrees celsius and turns the old glass into hot liquid. 
Ghanaian_Artist-15|Peta now 44. 
Ghanaian_Artist-16|Is the nation's only professional glass blower. 
Ghanaian_Artist-17|He uses a long pole to remove a ball of melted glass from the kiln. 
Ghanaian_Artist-18|And starts working to shape the glass into colorful items people can use again. 
Ghanaian_Artist-19|If he can teach more people to make art pieces from glass. 
Ghanaian_Artist-20|He can reduce his country's need to bring in glass from china. 
Ghanaian_Artist-21|Ghana imports about 300 million dollars worth of glass and pottery each year. 
Ghanaian_Artist-22|Says the observatory for economic complexity. 
Ghanaian_Artist-23|About 80% comes from china. 
Ghanaian_Artist-24|He hopes to make donna's. 
Ghanaian_Artist-25|Glass bead making tradition. 
Ghanaian_Artist-26|Into a larger industry. 
Ghanaian_Artist-27|With people doing many different jobs. 
Ghanaian_Artist-28|Glass is my passion my heart he said. 
Ghanaian_Artist-29|It takes you on a journey from one place to another. 
Ghanaian_Artist-30|In addition to helping his country keep more money in ghana today thinks a larger glass economy. 
Ghanaian_Artist-31|Will also make his country cleaner. 
Ghanaian_Artist-32|A glass waste collection program would help. 
Ghanaian_Artist-33|Today works in the area called odom asik robo. 
Ghanaian_Artist-34|And trains other glass blowers in his shop. 
Ghanaian_Artist-35|He learned how to make his equipment by watching videos on a computer. 
Ghanaian_Artist-36|He said he was trying to follow the designs. 
Ghanaian_Artist-37|Of well-known american glass artist dale chihuly. 
Ghanaian_Artist-38|My heart wants to train young ghanaians. 
Ghanaian_Artist-39|Both men and women. 
Ghanaian_Artist-40|So they can learn this job he said. 
Ghanaian_Artist-41|We will not have to go to other countries like china to buy what we want for ghana. 
Ghanaian_Artist-42|Over the years he has gotten better at the work now tetta's pieces. 
Ghanaian_Artist-43|Are sold in shops in ghana and ivory coast. 
Ghanaian_Artist-44|Some of his work is also sold. 
Ghanaian_Artist-45|In art stores in europe and the us. 
Ghanaian_Artist-46|I'm dan friedel. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-1|In his speech to the united states congress. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-2|Ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-3|Ask for help. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-4|His message was short and clear. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-5|We need you right now. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-6|In recent weeks. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-7|Selenski spoke to world leaders in one country after another. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-8|By video link. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-9|His speeches are excellent examples of persuasive speaking. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-10|The persuasive speech. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-11|Is one common exercise. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-12|The teachers give to students in communication or speech classes. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-13|Let us look at what makes an effective persuasive speech. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-14|First. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-15|You should choose a topic you know something about. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-16|Or have researched well to prepare for your speech. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-17|Make sure it is a subject about which people have different opinions. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-18|It would not be logical to speak about a fact recognised by everybody. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-19|It is also best to choose a subject your listeners care about. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-20|Or connect on. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-21|Do you see people in your town littering. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-22|You can expect that they care about how the town appears. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-23|Or that they can change their actions. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-24|So giving a speech about why littering harms your town's appearance. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-25|Might persuade people who do it to stop. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-26|You should consider your listeners as you plan your speech. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-27|What do they value. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-28|President zelensky. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-29|Book about protecting democracy to everyone. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-30|But he changed his speech to world leaders. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-31|A little. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-32|Depending on the history of each country. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-33|For the united states. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-34|He compared the russian invasion. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-35|With the attack on pearl harbor. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-36|And the september 11th attack. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-37|Both these events were important turning points in us history. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-38|In his speech to the leaders of israel he spoke of the holocaust. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-39|And how ukrainians helped to save jews during world war ii. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-40|Thinking of the things your listeners value will help you form arguments in your speech. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-41|If you want them to stop eating unhealthy foods for example. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-42|You may appeal to the value of their appearance. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-43|You will talk about how healthy foods result in good looking skin and an attractive body. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-44|There are three common ways to persuade people of your way of thinking. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-45|We use greek words to describe them. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-46|Because the ancient greeks developed and appealed to these ideas. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-47|They are. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-48|Ethos. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-49|Appeal to the listeners ethics. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-50|Or morals. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-51|Puzzles. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-52|Appeal to the listeners emotions. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-53|And logos. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-54|Appeal to the listeners logic or intelligence. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-55|Again. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-56|President zelensky speeches are excellent examples. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-57|Of how to use these three ideas. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-58|To persuade listeners to act. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-59|Representing ethos. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-60|In speaking to the german leaders. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-61|He said some german businesses had put more importance on economic gain. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-62|Then on morality. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-63|In an appeal to pathos. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-64|Zelensky. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-65|Play the video. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-66|Showing injured ukrainian children. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-67|To the us congress. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-68|To appeal to our emotions. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-69|And. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-70|In his speech to the british parliament in london. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-71|He made an appeal to logos. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-72|He said that like the british and world war ii. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-73|Ukrainians will never stop fighting. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-74|And so they need britain's help to continue. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-75|He used words similar to former british prime minister winston churchill's famous words. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-76|We shall fight on the beaches. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-77|We shall fight on the landing grounds. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-78|We shall fight in the fields and in the streets. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-79|The english translation of zalenski's words is. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-80|We will fight in the forest. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-81|In the field on the shores in the streets. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-82|After you plan the subject. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-83|Appeal to your listeners and the arguments you will use. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-84|You should make an outline of your speech. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-85|Start with an attention-getting statement. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-86|Then explain your main idea. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-87|And give evidence to support your argument. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-88|List the points you want to make. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-89|And think of how to answer arguments against your position. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-90|Finished with a call to action. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-91|What do you want your listeners to do. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-92|Finally. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-93|Practice at home until you need only a notecard with your main points on it. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-94|When you give the speech. 
Give_a_Persuasive_Speech-95|Do not plan to read the speech word-for-word from a paper.

HBCU-1|A big city might not seem like the best place to learn about nature and the environment. 
HBCU-2|But one group in washington dc is trying to change that. 
HBCU-3|City blossoms is a nonprofit organization with the goal of bringing nature to children who might not otherwise have green spaces. 
HBCU-4|The organization has assisted in creating green space at 7 elementary schools. 
HBCU-5|Two high schools. 
HBCU-6|And 18 early childhood centers across d.c.. 
HBCU-7|City blossoms has its own educators who teach children lessons centered on gardening and nature. 
HBCU-8|Tara mcnerney is the director of city blossoms and a former teacher. 
HBCU-9|She said city blossoms lessons center on environmental science. 
HBCU-10|Healthy living skills like cooking. 
HBCU-11|And artistic expression. 
HBCU-12|In the garden students can learn environmental ideas like plant life cycles or ecosystems. 
HBCU-13|But teachers can also use the green space for reading lessons by reading a garden related book. 
HBCU-14|Or learning nature vocabulary. 
HBCU-15|Even math could be taught in the garden. 
HBCU-16|We are really able to adapt into the subjects that the teachers are wanting to teach mcnerney said. 
HBCU-17|City blossoms partnerships with local schools are meant to last at least three to four years. 
HBCU-18|City blossoms assist schools in creating and caring for the garden. 
HBCU-19|But the gardens are mainly operated by the schools. 
HBCU-20|Mcnerney said she partners with schools that already understand the importance of an outdoor education and that want to keep the garden at the school for many years. 
HBCU-21|It's a school run program that city blossoms is supporting. 
HBCU-22|Mcnerney said. 
HBCU-23|We don't want it to be a plop and drop garden where it's seen as a city blossoms garden. 
HBCU-24|And it's not fully embraced by the community. 
HBCU-25|Because that won't really lead to a sustainable garden program. 
HBCU-26|In-city blossoms five other community gardens. 
HBCU-27|The organization supports the garden and provides nature activities for the community. 
HBCU-28|But the spaces remain community-driven. 
HBCU-29|At the end of the day we're not designing these sites said issa zambrano. 
HBCU-30|She helps maintain the community spaces for city blossoms. 
HBCU-31|The community designs it. 
HBCU-32|Every garden takes the shape of the community. 
HBCU-33|And the culture that exists there. 
HBCU-34|Young children and older adults have gotten involved with the community green spaces. 
HBCU-35|Said kendra hazel. 
HBCU-36|She oversees the community gardens for city blossoms. 
HBCU-37|During cooking lessons for example. 
HBCU-38|People will tell about meals that are special to their culture. 
HBCU-39|The community gardens represents the diversity of dc zambrano said. 
HBCU-40|It's like putting pieces together of so many different people and cultures and neighborhoods. 
HBCU-41|Healthy food is hard to find in some parts of washington d.c.. 
HBCU-42|Especially in poor areas. 
HBCU-43|About 15% of dc is a food desert. 
HBCU-44|A food desert is an area where the nearest supermarket is more than 1.6 km away. 
HBCU-45|In the two poorest sections of washington d.c.. 
HBCU-46|Ward 7 and 8. 
HBCU-47|There are just three supermarkets for 160,000 people. 
HBCU-48|7 of city blossoms gardens are in those two wards. 
HBCU-49|Part of the organization's mission is to grow in spaces that might not otherwise have green spaces. 
HBCU-50|It might not have fresh healthy food. 
HBCU-51|Mcnerney said. 
HBCU-52|For older students at to dc high schools. 
HBCU-53|Students learn how to grow and harvest crops. 
HBCU-54|Through city blossoms mighty brains program. 
HBCU-55|Students in the program also sell their vegetables and herbs. 
HBCU-56|At local farmers markets. 
HBCU-57|Well city blossoms main goal is to teach children. 
HBCU-58|Many older families and adults have also gotten involved. 
HBCU-59|The organization holds gardening lessons for all ages. 
HBCU-60|Hazel said the pandemic has made people want to spend more time outside experiencing nature. 
HBCU-61|People have really woken up to the fact that green spaces. 
HBCU-62|Are really important in our communities. 
HBCU-63|Hazel said. 
HBCU-64|They have realized the good that comes from being outside. 
HBCU-65|And being disconnected from technology. 
HBCU-66|And just being she added. 
HBCU-67|And getting your hands dirty. 
HBCU-68|I'm doing over there.

Harvard_Announces-37|The report's writers said harvard is now part of the long and growing list of american universities. 
Harvard_Announces-38|Entangled with the history of slavery. 
Harvard_Announces-39|Enslaved people worked at the university for almost 150 years. 
Harvard_Announces-40|Until slavery became illegal in massachusetts. 
Harvard_Announces-41|In 1783. 
Harvard_Announces-42|The schools report said. 
Harvard_Announces-43|At least 70 black people and native americans were enslaved. 
Harvard_Announces-44|That included people who worked on the university land. 
Harvard_Announces-45|And in the homes of the school's leaders. 
Harvard_Announces-46|In addition the university which is the richest in the us. 
Harvard_Announces-47|Gained wealth by investing in industries. 
Harvard_Announces-48|Such as cotton and sugarcane which used forced labor. 
Harvard_Announces-49|Those crops were grown by enslaved people in the american south. 
Harvard_Announces-50|And the caribbean islands. 
Harvard_Announces-51|Many buildings at harvard are named for people who owned other people. 
Harvard_Announces-52|The report notes that harvard has profited from the idea that slavery in the united states. 
Harvard_Announces-53|Was centered in the american south. 
Harvard_Announces-54|In fact the report says. 
Harvard_Announces-55|The economy in the northeastern colonies. 
Harvard_Announces-56|Thrived because of their connection to slavery. 
Harvard_Announces-57|And businesses that used forced labor. 
Harvard_Announces-58|Researchers said there were likely more than 70 enslaved people. 
Harvard_Announces-59|But they only found 70 names. 
Harvard_Announces-60|They added that some of the enslaved people were native americans. 
Harvard_Announces-61|Many of the enslaved people were known only by their first names which included. 
Harvard_Announces-62|Scissor. 
Harvard_Announces-63|Dinah. 
Harvard_Announces-64|Delia. 
Harvard_Announces-65|Benti and venus. 
Harvard_Announces-66|Back out announced the 100 million dollar fund. 
Harvard_Announces-67|To deal with what he called the corrosive effects of slavery on individuals. 
Harvard_Announces-68|On harvard and on our society. 
Harvard_Announces-69|The money will be used to make up for the mistreatment of the people who worked for the university. 
Harvard_Announces-70|But it will not be paid directly to the living family members of harvard's slaves. 
Harvard_Announces-71|The report said the university should permit some students at historically black colleges and universities. 
Harvard_Announces-72|To study at harvard for one year at a time. 
Harvard_Announces-73|It also said the school should make education more available for the descendants of slaves in the southern us and the caribbean area. 
Harvard_Announces-74|In addition. 
Harvard_Announces-75|The writers said harvard should offer educational programs. 
Harvard_Announces-76|Two members of native american tribes in the north-eastern us. 
Harvard_Announces-77|The report said that even after slavery became illegal some of the university's professors. 
Harvard_Announces-78|Todd racial theories. 
Harvard_Announces-79|About why white people were better than black people. 
Harvard_Announces-80|Some professors did studies on race that researchers. 
Harvard_Announces-81|Have connected to policies of the leaders of nazi germany. 
Harvard_Announces-82|The report called some of this work which included. 
Harvard_Announces-83|Photographing black people without clothing and measuring their bodies. 
Harvard_Announces-84|Abusive. 
Harvard_Announces-85|Back out called the findings disturbing and shocking. 
Harvard_Announces-86|And said the idea is permitted deeply immoral activities. 
Harvard_Announces-87|In more modern times the report noted. 
Harvard_Announces-88|The university was slow to make education and work available to black people. 
Harvard_Announces-89|Between the 1890s and 1940s only about three black men per year attended the university. 
Harvard_Announces-90|By 1960 that number had only grown to nine in the first-year class. 
Harvard_Announces-91|The report said the university should spend money. 
Harvard_Announces-92|To make up for the past. 
Harvard_Announces-93|But did not clearly say the school should give money. 
Harvard_Announces-94|To the descendants of the enslaved people who worked at harvard. 
Harvard_Announces-95|Payments to make up for bad treatment in the past are sometimes called reparations. 
Harvard_Announces-96|Harvard instead said it will make up for its wrongs through teaching research and service. 
Harvard_Announces-97|Other universities are doing similar things. 
Harvard_Announces-98|At georgetown university in washington dc. 
Harvard_Announces-99|The school is trying to raise $400,000 per year. 
Harvard_Announces-100|To give to the descendants of the enslaved people sold by the school. 
Harvard_Announces-101|At princeton university in new jersey. 
Harvard_Announces-102|The school of religion started a 27 million dollar fund. 
Harvard_Announces-103|To make up for enslaving people. 
Harvard_Announces-104|And the university of virginia. 
Harvard_Announces-105|Founded by us president thomas jefferson. 
Harvard_Announces-106|Created scholarships for the living family members. 
Harvard_Announces-107|Of those it enslaved. 
Harvard_Announces-108|However. 
Harvard_Announces-109|Some critics say those universities should do more. 
Harvard_Announces-110|Or. 
Harvard_Announces-111|But they are not following through on their promises. 
Harvard_Announces-112|Now that harvard has released its report. 
Harvard_Announces-113|Education leaders will want to see. 
Harvard_Announces-114|How the 100 million dollars is spent. 
Harvard_Announces-115|And whether it makes a difference. 
Harvard_Announces-116|In the report. 
Harvard_Announces-117|Back out noted that harvard is far from perfect. 
Harvard_Announces-118|But it always tries to be better. 
Harvard_Announces-119|The university president said harvard is committed to following the recommendation. 
Harvard_Announces-120|And embracing the challenges before us.

Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-4|The california-based company rocketlab. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-5|Carried out the operation. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-6|It was designed to demonstrate a method to make rockets reusable. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-7|It took place monday above the south pacific. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-8|Off new zealand. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-9|The helicopter was able to successfully grab onto a line attached to the falling rocket. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-10|However the pilot noticed load differences that were not experienced in past tests. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-11|The pilot decided to drop the booster in the sea as a safety measure. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-12|Rocket lab uses a launch vehicle system called electron to send satellites into orbit. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-13|For private companies.

Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-17|After the deployment the rockets maine booster began falling to earth. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-18|The boosters speed was slow to about 10 meters per second by a parachute. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-19|The capture method was attempted at about 2,000 meters as the booster fell. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-20|The crew used a sikorsky s-92 helicopter with a long line and hook attached. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-21|To grab onto the boosters parachute line. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-22|The successful capture brought cheers from ground controllers during a live internet broadcast of the event. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-23|But about 20 seconds later sounds of disappointment could be heard from controllers when the pilot let the rocket go. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-24|Rocket labs said in a statement. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-25|The decision to drop the booster was linked to different load characteristics that the helicopter team detected. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-26|Those differences had not been experienced in past test of the helicopter capture method the company said. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-27|Even with the unexpected result. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-28|Rocket lab creator and chief executive peter beck called the demonstration a big success. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-29|They got a great catch. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-30|They just didn't like the way the load was feeling. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-31|He told reporters after the attempt. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-32|Back noted that nearly everything else in the demonstration went exactly as planned. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-33|He said the unexpected load issue was a small problem that project team members will immediately start studying and working to fix. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-34|Back said he hoped the company could still save some or all of the rocket booster. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-35|Which was recovered from a boat after falling into the sea. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-36|Rocket lab says making its rockets reusable will permit the company to increase the number of the launches it makes and reduce costs. 
Helicopter_Catches_Rocket-37|American company spacex designed the first reusable orbital rocket the falcon 9.

High_Court-1|High school graduation rates in the united states dropped in at least 20 states. 
High_Court-2|After the first full school year during the coronavirus health crisis. 
High_Court-3|The information comes from the publication chalkbeat. 
High_Court-4|It suggests that the pandemic may have ended almost 20 years of improvement in high school graduation rates in america. 
High_Court-5|Graduation rates fell in some states. 
High_Court-6|Even though educators eased requirements to help struggling students. 
High_Court-7|The information comes from only 26 of the 50 states. 
High_Court-8|But it is the latest concerning trend in education. 
High_Court-9|Last year many students attended classes online. 
High_Court-10|And the new coronavirus continues to affect learning and teaching. 
High_Court-11|Educators fear that the next several graduating classes. 
High_Court-12|Could be affected even more. 
High_Court-13|In 2020 when schools closed for the final months of the school year. 
High_Court-14|Moose states east graduation requirements. 
High_Court-15|They reported a rise in graduation rates. 
High_Court-16|But the results were different for the class of 2021. 
High_Court-17|In 20 of 26 states that have released their information. 
High_Court-18|Graduation rates fell. 
High_Court-19|The associated press reports that complete national data will likely not be available until 2023. 
High_Court-20|Those decreases were less than a percentage point in some states. 
High_Court-21|Like colorado georgia and kansas. 
High_Court-22|But in other states they were larger. 
High_Court-23|Illinois oregon and north dakota. 
High_Court-24|Reported graduation rates decreases of two percentage points. 
High_Court-25|Indiana main nevada south dakota and west virginia. 
High_Court-26|Reported drops of at least one point. 
High_Court-27|Where rates did increase growth was small. 
High_Court-28|Florida has had graduation rates increased by more than two percentage points every year for 10 years. 
High_Court-29|But in 2021 it gained just one-tenth of a percentage point. 
High_Court-30|Roberts dolphins is an education researcher with johns hopkins university in maryland. 
High_Court-31|We do have to be concerned that grad rates are down and that some number of kids that earned a diploma. 
High_Court-32|They've learned less than prior years he said. 
High_Court-33|Last year's graduating class was affected in many different ways. 
High_Court-34|Nevada's washoecountyschools for example. 
High_Court-35|The graduation rates dropped by 2.6 percentage points. 
High_Court-36|Many high school students worked longer hours. 
High_Court-37|Or spend more time caring for family members. 
High_Court-38|Carly lotz is a counselor at a school in reno nevada. 
High_Court-39|She became concerned last year when students started working 40 to 50 hours a week. 
High_Court-40|Some students worked during remote school days. 
High_Court-41|While others took late-night hours that made them too tired to do school work. 
High_Court-42|Graduation rates across the whole country. 
High_Court-43|Are still higher now than they were a few years ago. 
High_Court-44|But the decreases are troubling too many people. 
High_Court-45|In 2001 an estimated 71% of us students who started public high school. 
High_Court-46|Graduated four years later. 
High_Court-47|By 2019 that number had risen to 86%. 
High_Court-48|Observers say that increase is a great success in american education. 
High_Court-49|A study by the brookings institution. 
High_Court-50|Suggested that the increases were the results of new pressure on states and schools. 
High_Court-51|From the federal government. 
High_Court-52|The study found little evidence that the long-term improvements were caused by lowering graduation requirements. 
High_Court-53|Some fear that all the effects of the pandemic will hit future graduating classes hardest. 
High_Court-54|Both oregon and nevada. 
High_Court-55|The share of first-year high school students who finished last school year in a position to graduate. 
High_Court-56|Was about 10 percentage points lower than before the pandemic. 
High_Court-57|Educators are hopeful however. 
High_Court-58|That last year's drop is not the sign of a trend. 
High_Court-59|In peoria illinois the graduation rate fell four points after rising for years. 
High_Court-60|But superintendent sharon does moomin karad. 
High_Court-61|Said the school system is expanding measures for struggling students. 
High_Court-62|Every week a team of educators. 
High_Court-63|Find students with failing grades and provides them extra support. 
High_Court-64|The school system has added waze working students can earn credits in the evenings or on weekends. 
High_Court-65|It has also employed workers to help students who are in the juvenile justice system to finish school. 
High_Court-66|It is not easy does movement ross said. 
High_Court-67|It's definitely a marathon. 
High_Court-68|Not sprint. 
High_Court-69|That means the effort is unlike a short race. 
High_Court-70|But more like a long difficult one. 
High_Court-71|I'm doing novak. 
High_School-1|Language teachers are always looking for new ways. 
High_School-2|To get their students to practice speaking in class. 
High_School-3|One way to get students to talk. 
High_School-4|Is to show them photographs. 
High_School-5|And ask them to talk about what they see. 
High_School-6|Many teachers may already have a collection of interesting pictures to use in class.

High_School-30|Or using certain grammatical forms. 
High_School-31|Here are two examples.

How_Technology_Is_Changing-1|News reporters are increasingly using technology tools to cover stories in new ways. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-2|One kind of news gathering is known as open source reporting. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-3|This is when reporters use publicly available materials to help them tell stories. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-4|These can include satellite images. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-5|Video from mobile phones or security cameras and social media information. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-6|The field of open-source reporting is still very young. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-7|But some major news organizations have already created separate news teams to center on technology-based reporting methods. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-8|The new york times newspaper has established. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-9|An investigative reporting department that specializes in open-source reporting. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-10|The washington post recently announced it was adding six people to a special video for renzyx team. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-11|The new york times published a story based on such reporting in march. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-12|The piece was based on radio communications between russian soldiers during the first 24 hours of a russian invasion of the town of muk a'reve outside kiev ukraine. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-13|The newspaper said it collected hundreds of recordings. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-14|From russian military forces that communicated in the field by radio. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-15|It said the communications were publicly available because they were not encrypted. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-16|Or protected by technology. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-17|The times said the recordings were captured and provided by amateur radio operators and open-source groups that gather communications from across the world. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-18|Some recordings suggested this organization in military activities. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-19|Russian soldiers were her describing a lack of supplies and non-working equipment. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-20|In one recording the times team noted that someone appearing to support ukraine broke into the communications and advised russian troops to go home. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-21|The times reporters said they did not only use information contained in the recordings for their story. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-22|They also attempted to confirm details such as dates times and places. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-23|Heard in the communications. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-24|They did this by collecting publicly-available videos social media messages and eyewitness descriptions. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-25|Another project the times team took on was a report called day of rage. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-26|It sought to piece together events during the january 6th. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-27|2021 riot at the us capitol. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-28|The report included video captured by protesters themselves as well as material from law enforcement. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-29|And reporters. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-30|It described in detail how the attack began. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-31|Who the protest leaders were and how people were killed. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-32|A x video investigation also provided information about an american drone attack that killed 10 civilians in afghanistan last year. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-33|Us military officials thought they had targeted a vehicle used by terrorists planning to attack. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-34|Couples airport. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-35|In the final days of a u.s. pull out from the country. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-36|But evidence presented in the times investigation. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-37|Showed that the drone attack. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-38|Killed a food aid worker who had been transporting water in areas near the airport. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-39|Two other adults and seven children also died in the strike. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-40|Us military officials later admitted that the drone had hit the wrong target. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-41|The availability of satellite images from private companies has also led news organizations to use them in open-source reporting. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-42|In one example the times used satellite images to quickly disprove russian claims that atrocities carried out in ukraine had been staged. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-43|Other technology including artificial intelligence. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-44|Is helping reporters seeking to learn how something happened. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-45|In 2018 the times worked with a british company to digitally rebuild a structure in syria. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-46|That helped disprove official denials about the use of chemical weapons. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-47|In a similar way the associated press created a 3d model of a theater in the ukrainian city of mariupol that was bombed by russian forces. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-48|The model combined with video and interviews with survivors lead to an investigative report that suggested more people died there than first thought. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-49|The ap has cooperated with other organizations on several open-source investigations. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-50|And is looking to further expand its own efforts. 
How_Technology_Is_Changing-51|These included a look into terror methods used by me and mars military government and examination of the effects of war on a gaza neighborhood.

Hydrogen-1|A new hydrogen-powered passenger boat is preparing to launch in san francisco california. 
Hydrogen-2|Builders of the 75 passenger boat. 
Hydrogen-3|Or fairy say it produces no carbon emissions. 
Hydrogen-4|The fairy named sea change. 
Hydrogen-5|Is set to begin carrying passengers across san francisco bay to several stops in the city. 
Hydrogen-6|In june. 
Hydrogen-7|The ferry is completely powered by hydrogen fuel cells. 
Hydrogen-8|In this kind of power system. 
Hydrogen-9|The fuel cells convert hydrogen gas. 
Hydrogen-10|Into electricity. 
Hydrogen-11|Seachange was built. 
Hydrogen-12|At the all american marine shipyard. 
Hydrogen-13|In bellingham in washington state. 
Hydrogen-14|It has been undergoing tests with the u.s. coast guard in nearby puget sound. 
Hydrogen-15|The project was financed by switch maritime. 
Hydrogen-16|Which owns the sea change. 
Hydrogen-17|The company's chief executive. 
Hydrogen-18|Pace raleigh told reuters the fairy is the first such vessel in the world. 
Hydrogen-19|To be completely powered by hydrogen fuel cells. 
Hydrogen-20|Rowley said he got the idea for the fairy. 
Hydrogen-21|Well trying to come up with new ways to use less carbon in the maritime industry. 
Hydrogen-22|He learned of a state-supported project in california. 
Hydrogen-23|That was developing hydrogen fuel cells as a method. 
Hydrogen-24|For decarbonizing ships. 
Hydrogen-25|So we joined up with them and funded their project. 
Hydrogen-26|In 2019. 
Hydrogen-27|Riley said. 
Hydrogen-28|The leader of the all-american marines project. 
Hydrogen-29|Is jeff sokol. 
Hydrogen-30|She said the hydrogen fuel cells power to propellers. 
Hydrogen-31|That move the ferry at a top speed. 
Hydrogen-32|Of about 37 km an hour. 
Hydrogen-33|He told reuters he thinks the fuel cell power systems. 
Hydrogen-34|Could one day become a new standard. 
Hydrogen-35|For many kinds of ships. 
Hydrogen-36|He said. 
Hydrogen-37|They're clean their efficient. 
Hydrogen-38|And they make sense economically. 
Hydrogen-39|Supporters of hydrogen fuel cells. 
Hydrogen-40|Say the technology is cleaner than other carbon cutting methods because the process only releases water and heat. 
Hydrogen-41|But the high cost and large fuel cell systems. 
Hydrogen-42|Have so far limited use of the technology. 
Hydrogen-43|We're focused on the shipping industry. 
Hydrogen-44|Because that's where we have expertise. 
Hydrogen-45|But i don't think any industry can really wait at this point. 
Hydrogen-46|Rowley said. 
Hydrogen-47|He added that he thinks the sea change project. 
Hydrogen-48|Can lead to more hydrogen fuel-cell vessels.

Important_Chemicals-1|A study of meteorites. 
Important_Chemicals-2|Has found more evidence. 
Important_Chemicals-3|That space rocks may have brought chemicals to earth. 
Important_Chemicals-4|That helped start life on the planet. 
Important_Chemicals-5|The meteorite studied had landed in australia. 
Important_Chemicals-6|Canada and the united states. 
Important_Chemicals-7|Earlier research on the objects. 
Important_Chemicals-8|Show they contained three of the five chemical components. 
Important_Chemicals-9|Necessary to form dna. 
Important_Chemicals-10|And rna. 
Important_Chemicals-11|Dna is the molecule that carries genetic instructions in living things. 
Important_Chemicals-12|Rna is the molecule important to the operation of jeans. 
Important_Chemicals-13|Researchers said recently they have now identified the final 2, kohl's. 
Important_Chemicals-14|That information comes from yasuhito ova. 
Important_Chemicals-15|Hokkaido university's institute of low-temperature science. 
Important_Chemicals-16|In japan. 
Important_Chemicals-17|Was the lead writer of the study that was published in nature communications. 
Important_Chemicals-18|The research findings support the idea that meteorites could have been an important source of organic compounds necessary for the emergence of earth's first organisms. 
Important_Chemicals-19|That study co-writer danny glover. 
Important_Chemicals-20|Of nasa's goddard space flight center in maryland. 
Important_Chemicals-21|Scientists have been seeking to better understand. 
Important_Chemicals-22|How chemical compounds came together to form a living thing able to reproduce itself. 
Important_Chemicals-23|The formation of dna and rna would be an important event. 
Important_Chemicals-24|As these molecules contain the instructions. 
Important_Chemicals-25|To build and operate organisms. 
Important_Chemicals-26|There is still much to learn about the chemical steps that led to the origin of life on earth. 
Important_Chemicals-27|Flap inside. 
Important_Chemicals-28|He added. 
Important_Chemicals-29|This research certainly adds to the list of chemical compounds. 
Important_Chemicals-30|It would have been present on earth before the emergence of life. 
Important_Chemicals-31|The researchers examined material from three meteorites. 
Important_Chemicals-32|One fell in 1950 near the town of murray. 
Important_Chemicals-33|In the us state of kentucky. 
Important_Chemicals-34|Another fell in 1969. 
Important_Chemicals-35|Near the town of murchison. 
Important_Chemicals-36|In australia's victoria state. 
Important_Chemicals-37|The final meteorite fell in 2000. 
Important_Chemicals-38|Tagish lake. 
Important_Chemicals-39|And the canadian province british columbia. 
Important_Chemicals-40|All three are made of rocky material. 
Important_Chemicals-41|Thought to have formed early in the solar system's history. 
Important_Chemicals-42|They are carbon-rich. 
Important_Chemicals-43|With the murchison and marie meteorites. 
Important_Chemicals-44|Containing about 2% organic carbon by weight. 
Important_Chemicals-45|And the tagish lake meteorite. 
Important_Chemicals-46|Containing about 4% organic carbon. 
Important_Chemicals-47|Carbon is a primary ingredient of organisms on earth. 
Important_Chemicals-48|All three meteorites contain a very complex mixture of organic molecules. 
Important_Chemicals-49|Most of which have not yet been identified. 
Important_Chemicals-50|Glad inside. 
Important_Chemicals-51|Formed about 4.5 billion years ago. 
Important_Chemicals-52|In its early days it was hit by meteorite. 
Important_Chemicals-53|Comet. 
Important_Chemicals-54|And other material from space. 
Important_Chemicals-55|The planets first organisms were simple microbes in the seas. 
Important_Chemicals-56|The earliest known fossils are of marine microbial life. 
Important_Chemicals-57|Dating to around 3.5 billion years ago. 
Important_Chemicals-58|But to technical components discovered in the latest study. 
Important_Chemicals-59|Are called cytosine and thymine. 
Important_Chemicals-60|The five would not have been the only chemical compounds necessary for life. 
Important_Chemicals-61|Among other things needed where sugars. 
Important_Chemicals-62|Fatty acids. 
Important_Chemicals-63|And amino acids. 
Important_Chemicals-64|Which are components of proteins and enzymes. 
Important_Chemicals-65|Herbicide. 
Important_Chemicals-66|The present results may not directly explain the beginning of life on the earth.

In_Teaching_Online-1|A recent story. 
In_Teaching_Online-2|In the wall street journal newspaper. 
In_Teaching_Online-3|Looked at students. 
In_Teaching_Online-4|Who went to celebrated universities. 
In_Teaching_Online-5|Such as columbia. 
In_Teaching_Online-6|And new york university in new york city. 
In_Teaching_Online-7|For advanced degrees. 
In_Teaching_Online-8|In subjects like art. 
In_Teaching_Online-9|Film and even social work. 
In_Teaching_Online-10|Many of the students said they learned a lot. 
In_Teaching_Online-11|However. 
In_Teaching_Online-12|When they graduated they were deep in debt. 
In_Teaching_Online-13|And did not think they would find work. 
In_Teaching_Online-14|That would let them pay back their loans. 
In_Teaching_Online-15|After graduation. 
In_Teaching_Online-16|Many students reported. 
In_Teaching_Online-17|Towing over $100,000. 
In_Teaching_Online-18|Meanwhile. 
In_Teaching_Online-19|They were earning just $50,000 a year. 
In_Teaching_Online-20|One student who received a master of fine arts. 
In_Teaching_Online-21|Nonna's and mfa. 
In_Teaching_Online-22|From columbia. 
In_Teaching_Online-23|Matte black. 
In_Teaching_Online-24|Told the newspaper. 
In_Teaching_Online-25|He was financially hobbled for life. 
In_Teaching_Online-26|And owed lenders. 
In_Teaching_Online-27|Close to $300,000. 
In_Teaching_Online-28|Students said they spoke with colombia about the high cost of advanced arts degrees. 
In_Teaching_Online-29|But never received a reasonable answer the newspaper reported. 
In_Teaching_Online-30|Education experts. 
In_Teaching_Online-31|Play these schools are very wealthy. 
In_Teaching_Online-32|With large endowments. 
In_Teaching_Online-33|Which could be used to pay students tuition. 
In_Teaching_Online-34|The university's however. 
In_Teaching_Online-35|Prefer to ask the students. 
In_Teaching_Online-36|To pay the full cost. 
In_Teaching_Online-37|One famous school yale. 
In_Teaching_Online-38|Is changing the system. 
In_Teaching_Online-39|It's theater program will be free to students. 
In_Teaching_Online-40|After a 150 million-dollar donation. 
In_Teaching_Online-41|From music and movie producer. 
In_Teaching_Online-42|David geffen. 
In_Teaching_Online-43|The data for the wall street journal story came from the united states department of education. 
In_Teaching_Online-44|And it was restricted to the two years after a student graduated. 
In_Teaching_Online-45|When representatives from the universities in the story. 
In_Teaching_Online-46|We're asked about their graduates. 
In_Teaching_Online-47|Financial problems. 
In_Teaching_Online-48|Many said two years. 
In_Teaching_Online-49|Is a short. of time. 
In_Teaching_Online-50|They said their graduates slowly increase their earnings. 
In_Teaching_Online-51|Overtime. 
In_Teaching_Online-52|In subjects like math medicine. 
In_Teaching_Online-53|Science and computer programming. 
In_Teaching_Online-54|Advanced degrees are often required for first-year jobs. 
In_Teaching_Online-55|However in more creative careers like writing making movies or painting. 
In_Teaching_Online-56|People can be very successful. 
In_Teaching_Online-57|Without getting an advanced degree. 
In_Teaching_Online-58|Kevin carey is a higher education expert. 
In_Teaching_Online-59|For new america. 
In_Teaching_Online-60|A public policy research center. 
In_Teaching_Online-61|He called master's degrees. 
In_Teaching_Online-62|A scam. 
In_Teaching_Online-63|In a conversation with the website slate.com. 
In_Teaching_Online-64|Charging people a ton of money to go into any artistic career. 
In_Teaching_Online-65|Is often super problematic he said. 
In_Teaching_Online-66|Kerry also said school say we need the money. 
In_Teaching_Online-67|When asked about the high cost of their master's degrees. 
In_Teaching_Online-68|But everyone needs money he said. 
In_Teaching_Online-69|Adding. 
In_Teaching_Online-70|It is a poor defense. 
In_Teaching_Online-71|Even in careers like law or business. 
In_Teaching_Online-72|Advanced degrees are no guarantee of financial success. 
In_Teaching_Online-73|The same wall street journal writers. 
In_Teaching_Online-74|Looked at law school graduates from the university of miami in florida. 
In_Teaching_Online-75|They saw recent graduates often borrowed. 
In_Teaching_Online-76|$150,000 to go to law school. 
In_Teaching_Online-77|2 years after graduation. 
In_Teaching_Online-78|They were earning just $59,000. 
In_Teaching_Online-79|Sergio castillo is an actor in new york city. 
In_Teaching_Online-80|He said he owes so much money on his student loans. 
In_Teaching_Online-81|But he no longer pants them. 
In_Teaching_Online-82|He went to the university of california at los angeles. 
In_Teaching_Online-83|And then earned an mfa from the actors studio in new york city. 
In_Teaching_Online-84|He does not expect to earn a lot of money from acting. 
In_Teaching_Online-85|Was his mfa worth the cost. 
In_Teaching_Online-86|I just think it was worth it i don't put a price tag on my education or my experience. 
In_Teaching_Online-87|I think it's sort of unfortunate. 
In_Teaching_Online-88|People take for granted education so many people people like my mother. never got to go to. 
In_Teaching_Online-89|Castillo said students who are thinking about. 
In_Teaching_Online-90|An advanced degree in art. 
In_Teaching_Online-91|Should be sure they are doing it. 
In_Teaching_Online-92|Because they value the education. 
In_Teaching_Online-93|Not because they want money. 
In_Teaching_Online-94|Or to be famous. 
In_Teaching_Online-95|A lot of other things you can do. 
In_Teaching_Online-96|Don't go in there for that reason. 
In_Teaching_Online-97|Lynn adrian is a former television producer who runs the broadcast journalism graduate program in washington dc. 
In_Teaching_Online-98|For syracuse university. 
In_Teaching_Online-99|She said students must ask. 
In_Teaching_Online-100|An important question. 
In_Teaching_Online-101|When they are thinking about graduate school. 
In_Teaching_Online-102|Is it worth. 
In_Teaching_Online-103|The investment of all that money for that master's degree and what is it going to turn into later. 
In_Teaching_Online-104|In some fields people may have better experiences working as an assistant. 
In_Teaching_Online-105|Then spending money on graduate school. 
In_Teaching_Online-106|Adrian warned that the cost of higher education in the us. 
In_Teaching_Online-107|Is a serious issue. 
In_Teaching_Online-108|I just think that there is a reckoning coming in terms of college tuition in general. 
In_Teaching_Online-109|And the bang-for-the-buck that wouldn't guess. 
In_Teaching_Online-110|She said. 
In_Teaching_Online-111|Tasha plucinski is a filmmaker in new york city. 
In_Teaching_Online-112|She came to the us from poland. 
In_Teaching_Online-113|To study about 10 years ago. 
In_Teaching_Online-114|She attended graduate school both at baylor university in texas. 
In_Teaching_Online-115|And at the university of iowa. 
In_Teaching_Online-116|She said she received a lot of financial support from those universities. 
In_Teaching_Online-117|When asked about the high cost of graduate school in the us. 
In_Teaching_Online-118|She described it with one word. 
In_Teaching_Online-119|Insanity. 
In_Teaching_Online-120|It is so insane. 
In_Teaching_Online-121|I mean i know friends who are stuck with the death. 
In_Teaching_Online-122|They are not taking risks in life. 
In_Teaching_Online-123|Even changing the job because they're so afraid. 
In_Teaching_Online-124|Pleasants kased arts graduate programs can help students meet and make friends. 
In_Teaching_Online-125|With fellow artists. 
In_Teaching_Online-126|With whom they can work throughout their careers. 
In_Teaching_Online-127|It's even better if the school is in a place like new york or los angeles. 
In_Teaching_Online-128|Those interviewed. 
In_Teaching_Online-129|Do not have a solution. 
In_Teaching_Online-130|For the problem of costly advanced degrees. 
In_Teaching_Online-131|In creative subjects. 
In_Teaching_Online-132|For a school to be a value plucinski said students need to remember why they started making arts in the beginning. 
In_Teaching_Online-133|Gorgeous.

International_Students-29|For international and american students scholars and researchers. 
International_Students-30|Iie research showed that about 55,000 fewer chinese students studied at us universities last school year. 
International_Students-31|That was the biggest drop. 
International_Students-32|China sends the most students to the us. 
International_Students-33|About 30% of the international student population in america. 
International_Students-34|Comes from china. 
International_Students-35|India is second with 18%. 
International_Students-36|The most popular fields of study for international students. 
International_Students-37|Our engineering math and computer science. 
International_Students-38|Over 40% of international students study those subjects each year. 
International_Students-39|The pandemic cut by 45% the number of new international students studying in the us. 
International_Students-40|The report included students taking classes in person. 
International_Students-41|And those attending classes by video from home. 
International_Students-42|About 45,000 fewer international students. 
International_Students-43|Worked on graduate degrees.

International_Students-51|The recent report was not as worrying as some people expected based on the increase in coronavirus infections over the summer. 
International_Students-52|The associated press reported. 
International_Students-53|Is that a slowdown in visa processing vaccinations. 
International_Students-54|And international travel for young people. 
International_Students-55|Were the reasons for the lower numbers. 
International_Students-56|For example is a student from vietnam studying. 
International_Students-57|At the university of san francisco. 
International_Students-58|He only made it to california on november 1st. 
International_Students-59|Because of travel restrictions at home. 
International_Students-60|He was not able to get vaccinated and to ho chi minh city for a flight to the us.

International_Students-62|He said his professors were very supportive and helped him by recording classes so he could watch them in vietnam. 
International_Students-63|Some chinese students who are supposed to be taking classes at new york university.

International_Students-65|But cannot get to the us are using the university's. 
International_Students-66|Center in shanghai for studying.

International_Students-72|At the university of illinois. 
International_Students-73|The school lost. 
International_Students-74|28% of its international students last school year. 
International_Students-75|But this year. 
International_Students-76|Student numbers have returned to the level of 2019 2020. 
International_Students-77|Andy borst is the university of illinois director of undergraduate admissions. 
International_Students-78|Undergraduates are students who have not yet learned the college degree. 
International_Students-79|He said. 
International_Students-80|Those students increased the most. 
International_Students-81|India sent 70% more students than before the pandemic. 
International_Students-82|He called the numbers a return to normal for our international populations. 
International_Students-83|He said the demand for higher education was pent-up. 
International_Students-84|Lussenhop from the state department said the us expects the increase in student interest to continue. 
International_Students-85|Because students continue to value a u.s. education. 
International_Students-86|Some people give credit to the administration of president joe biden. 
International_Students-87|For speaking in support of international students. 
International_Students-88|In july us officials including secretary of state and tony blinken and education secretary miguel cardona. 
International_Students-89|Recorded video messages.

International_Students-92|An organization that supports international education based in washington. 
International_Students-93|She said the new administration is telling the world. 
International_Students-94|International students are important for the us. 
International_Students-95|Experts are worried however that the increase in students will only help schools that are already popular. 
International_Students-96|They sang smaller schools and community colleges may not recover. 
International_Students-97|Across the u.s.. 
International_Students-98|The two-year schools. 
International_Students-99|Suffered a 24% loss of international students. 
International_Students-100|In addition. 
International_Students-101|Researchers are still trying to find out. 
International_Students-102|If the jump and students will continue past this school year. 
International_Students-103|Universities in canada australia. 
International_Students-104|And great britain. 
International_Students-105|We're competing for students with the us even before the pandemic.

Invasive_Frui_Tree-4|Requested an order of calorie pear tree seeds from china. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-5|The agency hopes the seeds might be a solution. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-6|For a bacterial disease harming american a production. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-7|Today however. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-8|Experts from the usda.

Invasive_Frui_Tree-22|Over the years. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-23|25 different kinds of ornamental trees. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-24|Were created from this combination. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-25|The wild down bradford pear tree was one of them.

Invasive_Frui_Tree-31|The agency described them as trees that flowers several times during the year. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-32|And do well in many climates and soils. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-33|That ability to survive easily is part of what makes the trees invasive. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-34|Seeds from the inedible fruit that the trees produce can spread easily. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-35|In addition. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-36|The roots can produce above-ground grow. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-37|If the growth is not cut down often to stop it from flowering. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-38|It can create a fertile seed with the rest of the tree. 
Invasive_Frui_Tree-39|It is possible for a wild population.

MIT_Professor-35|Elias is head of the rutgers university social emotional and character development lab in new jersey. 
MIT_Professor-36|They build strong relationships and connections with the kids. 
MIT_Professor-37|They have a tremendous influence on their mental health. 
MIT_Professor-38|Sarah papinka teachers eight subjects as the only art teacher at putnam high school in connecticut. 
MIT_Professor-39|When classes went online. 
MIT_Professor-40|She asked her photography students to take pictures of how their lives had changed. 
MIT_Professor-41|Her drawing and painting students. 
MIT_Professor-42|Also made pieces reacting to the pandemic. 
MIT_Professor-43|Many of her students work was filled with rage. 
MIT_Professor-44|Papinka told voa. 
MIT_Professor-45|1 students who saw school as an escape from home life. 
MIT_Professor-46|Was unable to leave home during the pandemic. 
MIT_Professor-47|Through artwork. 
MIT_Professor-48|She was able to express herself. 
MIT_Professor-49|But it was also a way for her teachers to see where she was at mentally. 
MIT_Professor-50|Since i wasn't hearing from her very often. 
MIT_Professor-51|Troubling work from the student led to a discussion which would involve school mental health experts. 
MIT_Professor-52|Potranco said her art classes. 
MIT_Professor-53|Are often a decompression time for students. 
MIT_Professor-54|She said her school system is in a poor part of connecticut. 
MIT_Professor-55|Many of her students care for younger relatives. 
MIT_Professor-56|Or work part-time jobs to provide their family with extra money. 
MIT_Professor-57|I think i said one of her high school students recently had a child. 
MIT_Professor-58|It had a difficult home life. 
MIT_Professor-59|Even before the pandemic. 
MIT_Professor-60|But pickett said he is involved with the baby's life. 
MIT_Professor-61|But he is struggling with his schoolwork. 
MIT_Professor-62|And at risk of dropping out. 
MIT_Professor-63|As school is no longer important to him. 
MIT_Professor-64|The student has taken a strong interest in designing tattoo art. 
MIT_Professor-65|Tattoos are ink pictures drawn on a person skin that are permanent. 
MIT_Professor-66|He has asked patinka for materials so he could work on his drawings outside of class. 
MIT_Professor-67|He can balance what he's been struggling with academically. 
MIT_Professor-68|With some success in the art room. 
MIT_Professor-69|Papinka said. 
MIT_Professor-70|It's nice to see him still working on something that captures him. 
MIT_Professor-71|Shawna longo is a longtime music teacher in new jersey. 
MIT_Professor-72|She told musicforall that teaching music is a way for students to have fun while exploring their personalities. 
MIT_Professor-73|She said that in many years time her students may not remember the notes to a song. 
MIT_Professor-74|But they're going to remember how they felt. 
MIT_Professor-75|And that to me. 
MIT_Professor-76|Is of utmost importance. 
MIT_Professor-77|I'm doing novak. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-1|Japanese railway company tokyo. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-2|Says it now uses only renewable energy. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-3|To power its train operations. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-4|That means tokyo huge network of train lines in and around tokyo do not produce any carbon dioxide emissions. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-5|The change took place april 1st. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-6|Toq employs 3855 people. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-7|And connect tokyo. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-8|With the nearby city of yokohama. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-9|It has more than 100 km of railway tracks. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-10|Serving 2.2 million people a day. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-11|It is the first railroad operator in japan. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-12|To have reached the goal of zero carbon emissions. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-13|It says the carbon dioxide reduction is equal. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-14|To the yearly average emissions. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-15|Of 56,000 japanese households. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-16|Nicholas little is director of railway education at michigan state university. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-17|He praised tokyo. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-18|For supporting renewable energy. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-19|But he noted it is also important. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-20|To improve ways of creating renewable energy. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-21|The bigger impacts come from increasing electricity generation. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-22|From renewable sources. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-23|Little said. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-24|The long-term battle is to increase production of renewable electricity. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-25|So is tokyo's move to renewables. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-26|Just a campaign for good publicity. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-27|Or is the company moving in the right direction for the environment. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-28|There is no simple answer says one expert. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-29|Bill takagi is a professor at kogaku in university. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-30|And specialist in electric railway systems. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-31|He says bigger environmental gains. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-32|Would come from changing rural operations. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-33|Diesel fuel. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-34|To hydrogen power. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-35|Or switching to electric automobiles. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-36|Tokyo's action is better than nothing. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-37|But takagi said. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-38|I am not going out of my way to praise it is great. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-39|Tokyo official yoshimasa kitano. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-40|Says the company plans more action toward cleaner operations. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-41|We don't see this as reaching our goal. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-42|But just a start. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-43|Kitano said. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-44|Such steps are critical for japan. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-45|The world's 6. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-46|Biggest carbon polluter. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-47|The country has a goal of becoming carbon-neutral. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-48|By the year 2050. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-49|About 20% of japan's electricity comes from renewable sources. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-50|Does japan's institute for sustainable energy policies. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-51|That is far behind new zealand for example. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-52|Where 84% of power used. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-53|Comes from renewable energy sources. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-54|New zealand hopes to make that 100% by 2035. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-55|The renewable sources driving tokyo trains include hydropower. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-56|Geothermal power. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-57|Wind power and solar power. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-58|That information comes from tokyo electric power company. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-59|The utility that provides the electricity and looks at its energy sourcing. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-60|Since japan's 2011 nuclear disaster in fukushima. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-61|The country has shut down most of its nuclear plants. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-62|And increased use of coal-fired power plants. 
Major_Japanese_Rail-63|Japan aims to have 36 to 38% of its energy come from renewable sources.

Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-1|Greenland's glaciers
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-2|continue to melt away because of rising global temperatures
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-3|but the melting ice might provide a way to lessen the impacts of climate change
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-4|as the ice melts it deposits tiny silt
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-5|silt is very small sand mud or other material
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-6|carried by running water
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-7|it's a kind of Wonder material said Minnick Rosen
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-8|he is a native Greenland ER and professor at the University of Copenhagen
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-9|cold glacial Rock flour
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-10|the silt is crushed to tiny particles by the weights of the melting ice
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-11|1 billion tons of the silt is deposited per year on Greenland
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-12|the world's largest island
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-13|bruising and his team have found the nutrient-rich mud improves plant growth when used in farms
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-14|it also absorbs carbon dioxide from the air in the process
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-15|researchers from the University of Ghana
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-16|we're able to increase corn production by 30% using glacial Rock flour
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-17|the flower decrease the effect of rain and heat on poor farmland
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-18|the tiny size of the silts particles
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-19|is what allows plants more access to nutrients including potassium
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-20|calcium and silicon
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-21|compared to normal Rocky farmland
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-22|we are the stage in this project where we definitely know that it works
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-23|roesing said
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-24|there are many barriers between this and a big-scale industry
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-25|but the potential is definitely there
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-26|the tiny size of the stilts particles also helps speed up a natural process
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-27|in which rocks absorb carbon dioxide
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-28|or CO2
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-29|when the Celtics dissolves in rainwater and releases its nutrients
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-30|a chemical reaction occurs that absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-31|the silt is eventually deposited in the sea
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-32|the idea of putting tiny Rock in Farmland is not new
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-33|but the method has gained more interest because of the discovery that it can absorb CO2
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-34|that realization has been a catalyst for a lot more research in this area
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-35|said David beerling
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-36|he is a professor at the University of Sheffield
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-37|and head author of a study on crushed basalt
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-38|a tiny volcanic rock
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-39|the study found that spreading finally crushed Basalt on fields
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-40|as well as helping crops to grow
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-41|remove CO2 from the atmosphere
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-42|and it does so at a cost about equal to other methods of carbon capture
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-43|such detailed research has not been done for glacial Rock flour
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-44|but tests by the scientist in Copenhagen
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-45|found that one ton of glacial Rock flour would accept between 250 and 300 kg of CO2
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-46|when applied to fields
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-47|that may also permit Farmers to sell that as carbon credits
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-48|Greenland's new government hopes the sales can one day help the economy
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-49|as well as permits the country to move away from some kinds of mining
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-50|we don't need to blast off the top of a mountain
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-51|or build a processing plant
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-52|Greenland's resources Minister told possible investors in September
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-53|government officials will present the mineral at a mining meeting in Vancouver early next year
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-54|what's a commercial Mining and use could be years away
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-55|the scientists at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Ghana
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-56|say success could improve food security
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-57|and economic inequality
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-58|good Farmland is not equally spread around the world
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-59|studies show that the best Farmland which is across parts of North America and Europe
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-60|was covered by Ice during the last ice age
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-61|just as in Greenland's today
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-62|the thick layer of ice has made the soil healthier
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-63|in northern Europe
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-64|we think the reason we're better off than the rest of the world
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-65|is that we are so much smarter than everyone else
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-66|in fact
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-67|we just have better soil

Moderna_Seeks_COVID-1|American drugmaker moderna. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-2|Is asking us officials to approve its covid-19 vaccine. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-3|For the nation's youngest children. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-4|Children under 5 are the only group in the united states not yet able to be vaccinated. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-5|Families have been waiting a long time to protect their young children. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-6|Even as people are gathering in higher numbers. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-7|And wearing fewer face coverings. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-8|But coronavirus variance continue to spread. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-9|Moderne provided its study results to the food and drug administration. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-10|Or fda. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-11|The drug company hopes the information proves. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-12|That's too low dose shots. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-13|Can protect babies and young children. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-14|There is an important unmet medical need here with these youngest kids. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-15|Said dr. paul burton. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-16|He is madera knows chief medical officer. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-17|Two shots for children will safely protect them. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-18|I think it is likely that overtime. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-19|They will need additional doses. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-20|Currently pfizer's vaccine is the only one approved for children. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-21|But that vaccine is only for children over the age of five. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-22|That leaves 18 million young children and babies. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-23|Unprotected. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-24|Pfizer is also expected to announce whether three of its even smaller dose shots. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-25|Work for very young children. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-26|The fda said in february. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-27|That's the company's two doses were not strong enough. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-28|Some families have questioned why a shot for young children has taken so long. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-29|Fda vaccine chief dr. peter marks. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-30|Told us lawmakers this week. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-31|That's the fda cannot evaluate a product. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-32|Until a producer completes its application. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-33|In a statement thursday. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-34|The fda said moderna still must send some additional data. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-35|To complete its request. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-36|It's critically important that we have the proper evaluation. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-37|So that parents will have trust in any vaccines that we authorize. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-38|Mark said. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-39|If the fda approves modernos vaccine for young children and babies. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-40|The us centers for disease control and prevention. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-41|Or cdc. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-42|Would then have to recommend who needs it. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-43|It could either be for all young children. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-44|Or just those at higher risk from covid-19. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-45|The fda will face some complex questions. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-46|The two moderna shots for young children. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-47|Are each 1/4 of the normal dose for an adult. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-48|In a study of kids ages 6 months through 5 years. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-49|Data showed that the doses produced high levels. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-50|Of virus-fighting antibodies. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-51|It was the same amount produced in young adults burton said. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-52|There were no serious side effects reported. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-53|And the shots resulted in fewer high body temperatures. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-54|Then other usual vaccines for children. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-55|Moderna vaccine proved between about 40% and 50% effective. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-56|At preventing symptomatic covid-19 during the trial. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-57|Burton said the omicron variants ability to partly escape vaccine immunity. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-58|Was a reason that effectiveness was not higher. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-59|Moderna covid vaccine so far has only been available to adults in the us. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-60|Other countries have already been offering the shots to children as young as six. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-61|But months ago the fda said it had concerns about a rare heart-related side effects. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-62|In teenage boys. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-63|Covid-19 generally is not as dangerous for children as it is for adults. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-64|But a small number have become very sick or even died. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-65|About 475 children younger than 5 have died from covid-19 since the pandemic start. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-66|The cdc says. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-67|Child hospitalization. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-68|Greatly increased during the spread of omicron. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-69|It is not clear how many parents plan to vaccinate their young children and babies. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-70|Less than one-third of children ages 5 to 11. 
Moderna_Seeks_COVID-71|I've had two vaccinations.

Music_Stars_Returning-3|Even for middle-income venezuelans. 
Music_Stars_Returning-4|Ticket prices for international stars. 
Music_Stars_Returning-5|Go from about $55 to as high as $600. 
Music_Stars_Returning-6|Last month. 
Music_Stars_Returning-7|Mexican music star alejandro fernandez. 
Music_Stars_Returning-8|Performed before thousands of cheering fans at a theater in caracas. 
Music_Stars_Returning-9|Some of the fans had gotten bank loans to pay for their tickets. 
Music_Stars_Returning-10|Such major performances in the capital were relatively common in the past. 
Music_Stars_Returning-11|Superstars like the backstreet boys were so popular that venezuelans would wait in line. 
Music_Stars_Returning-12|Even overnight. 
Music_Stars_Returning-13|To get tickets. 
Music_Stars_Returning-14|Shakira guns and roses and juanes are among others that used to perform in the country. 
Music_Stars_Returning-15|But in 2010 visits by major performers begin to slow. 
Music_Stars_Returning-16|Venezuela was entering and economic and political crisis that would continue for years. 
Music_Stars_Returning-17|Today about 75% of venezuela's population still lives on less than $2 a day. 
Music_Stars_Returning-18|But for those who have found good private industry jobs. 
Music_Stars_Returning-19|Entered the gig economy. 
Music_Stars_Returning-20|Or have a business things are improving. 
Music_Stars_Returning-21|The country no longer restricts transactions in u.s. dollars. 
Music_Stars_Returning-22|The value of the bolivar venezuela's money. 
Music_Stars_Returning-23|Had dropped greatly. 
Music_Stars_Returning-24|As a result of inflation. 
Music_Stars_Returning-25|Good change in monetary rules signals to show organizers that more venezuelans will be free to buy tickets. 
Music_Stars_Returning-26|People can go to big shows in the country once again. 
Music_Stars_Returning-27|They are going to book cities and venues based on venues they could sell. 
Music_Stars_Returning-28|Said jeffrey dornfeld. 
Music_Stars_Returning-29|He is a music industry professor at berklee college of music in boston massachusetts. 
Music_Stars_Returning-30|Artists are not going to wants to play to half houses. 
Music_Stars_Returning-31|They don't like to see empty chairs. 
Music_Stars_Returning-32|The objective is to fill the room with paid attendance. 
Music_Stars_Returning-33|Dornfeld added. 
Music_Stars_Returning-34|Caracas businessman edgar villanueva attended the alejandro fernandez show along with his wife. 
Music_Stars_Returning-35|Two daughters and a son-in-law. 
Music_Stars_Returning-36|One of his daughters had learned of the concert on instagram. 
Music_Stars_Returning-37|And immediately thought the tickets. 
Music_Stars_Returning-38|As he waited to enter the theater. 
Music_Stars_Returning-39|Villanueva said he recognized his country's problems. 
Music_Stars_Returning-40|But he added that he is not a politician. 
Music_Stars_Returning-41|And just wanted to have a good time with his family.

Music_Stars_Returning-50|Bahamas are paid around $75 for her ticket. 
Music_Stars_Returning-51|She hopes to see the backstreet boys return to venezuela one day. 
Music_Stars_Returning-52|Mexican rock band mana is also on her list. 
Music_Stars_Returning-53|Still attendance for her is very costly. 
Music_Stars_Returning-54|There is a part of the population that can still afford it she said. 
Music_Stars_Returning-55|And there is another that like us has had to scrape together and even get a loan. 
Music_Stars_Returning-56|I'm ashley thompson. 
Musician_Seeks-1|War kept naseer shamma away from his homeland of iraq for years. 
Musician_Seeks-2|Now the famous musician hopes to rebuild his country with performances and project. 
Musician_Seeks-3|To support culture and education. 
Musician_Seeks-4|Trauma performed last week at the araki national theater. 
Musician_Seeks-5|The crowd was on their feet cheering as shama played classic araki and modern songs. 
Musician_Seeks-6|He played with an orchestra as well as young women musicians. 
Musician_Seeks-7|Who played traditional instruments. 
Musician_Seeks-8|We will work on letting the stage to get out of the darkness into the light. 
Musician_Seeks-9|He told the crowd. 
Musician_Seeks-10|The 59 year-old sharma is considered a master player. 
Musician_Seeks-11|The old is a pear-shaped stringed instrument similar to a lute. 
Musician_Seeks-12|The instrument is central to arabic music. 
Musician_Seeks-13|Born in the southern city of coots. 
Musician_Seeks-14|He received his first i would lessen at the age of 11. 
Musician_Seeks-15|He later graduated from the baghdad academy of music in 1987. 
Musician_Seeks-16|Before iraq in 1993 during saddam hussein's dictatorship. 
Musician_Seeks-17|He eventually gained international fame performing around the world. 
Musician_Seeks-18|And receiving many awards. 
Musician_Seeks-19|In cairo he started the house of the owl a school for teaching the instrument to new generations. 
Musician_Seeks-20|Trauma currently lives in berlin germany. 
Musician_Seeks-21|He returned to iraq for the first time in 2012. 
Musician_Seeks-22|For a performance supported by the arab league. 
Musician_Seeks-23|He said he was shocked and felt great sadness. 
Musician_Seeks-24|To see what had become of his country. 
Musician_Seeks-25|Iraq had been through repeated war and violence. 
Musician_Seeks-26|After the us led war that defeated so down. 
Musician_Seeks-27|He returned several times since most recently in 2017. 
Musician_Seeks-28|At that time iraq was torn apart and its battle with islamic state group militants. 
Musician_Seeks-29|Who had captured much of the north. 
Musician_Seeks-30|This was sharma's first time back to a country mostly eyepiece. 
Musician_Seeks-31|But it is in the middle of an economic crisis. 
Musician_Seeks-32|He said the city is more at ease and the audience more responsive. 
Musician_Seeks-33|The audience's artistic tastes had changed as a result of wars. 
Musician_Seeks-34|But last night it was similar to the audience's of the 80s. 
Musician_Seeks-35|I felt as if it was in an international concert like one in berlin. 
Musician_Seeks-36|Sharma said after a recent performance. 
Musician_Seeks-37|It was the first of four concerts he is holding in baghdad this month. 
Musician_Seeks-38|The concert same to bring attention to iraq worsening education system. 
Musician_Seeks-39|The education system has suffered under years of conflict. 
Musician_Seeks-40|Government carelessness and corruption. 
Musician_Seeks-41|The world bank says that education levels in iraq are now among the lowest in the middle east and north africa. 
Musician_Seeks-42|They were once considered one of the highest in the area. 
Musician_Seeks-43|Money gained from the concerts will go toward improving the music and ballet school in baghdad.

Musician_Seeks-59|It gives me hope in life. 
Musician_Seeks-60|I'm doing over. 
Muslim_Students-1|Some muslim students in southern india. 
Muslim_Students-2|Have chosen to stay away from school. 
Muslim_Students-3|Rather than obey a band. 
Muslim_Students-4|Unhinged jobs. 
Muslim_Students-5|The hijab ban began in january. 
Muslim_Students-6|At a government-run junior college. 
Muslim_Students-7|In the city of dubai. 
Muslim_Students-8|In carnatic province. 
Muslim_Students-9|The junior college is similar to a high school in the united states. 
Muslim_Students-10|Some students protested the band by staying outside and attempted to hold classes there. 
Muslim_Students-11|They argued that muslim students had long been permitted to wear hijabs at school. 
Muslim_Students-12|More schools in the state. 
Muslim_Students-13|Soon ordered similar bands. 
Muslim_Students-14|This led to demonstrations by hundreds of muslim women and counter-protests held by hindu students. 
Muslim_Students-15|The hijab head covering is worn by many muslim women to show modesty or as a sign of their religious belief. 
Muslim_Students-16|Opponents consider it a sign of oppression. 
Muslim_Students-17|That is forced upon women. 
Muslim_Students-18|That idea is rejected by hijab supporters. 
Muslim_Students-19|They say it has different meanings for different people. 
Muslim_Students-20|Including as an expression of muslim identity. 
Muslim_Students-21|6 students brought a legal case to have the band's overturned. 
Muslim_Students-22|Arguing that they violated their rights to education and religious freedom. 
Muslim_Students-23|But on march 15th. 
Muslim_Students-24|An indian court upheld the ban. 
Muslim_Students-25|In its ruling the court said it did not consider the hijab unnecessary practice of islam. 
Muslim_Students-26|The issue has started new debates over the rights of muslims in india. 
Muslim_Students-27|Muslims make up 14% of the country's 1.4 billion people. 
Muslim_Students-28|Muslim groups have accused the government of pushing them aside as a minority in the population. 
Muslim_Students-29|They see restrictions on his jobs as a worrying sign of hindu nationalism. 
Muslim_Students-30|Under prime minister narendra modi. 
Muslim_Students-31|Modi's bharatiya janata party rules the state of karnataka. 
Muslim_Students-32|Aaliyah assadi is a student in the state. 
Muslim_Students-33|When she was 12 she wore a hijab while representing the state. 
Muslim_Students-34|Out of karate competition. 
Muslim_Students-35|She won gold at the event. 
Muslim_Students-36|But when she recently tried to wear the head covering to her junior college. 
Muslim_Students-37|She was blocked from entering. 
Muslim_Students-38|It's not just a piece of cloth. 
Muslim_Students-39|Asadi told the associated press. 
Muslim_Students-40|Hijab is my identity. 
Muslim_Students-41|And right now what they're doing is taking away my identity from me. 
Muslim_Students-42|She said. 
Muslim_Students-43|To reduce tensions in the state. 
Muslim_Students-44|Officials closed schools and colleges for 3 days. 
Muslim_Students-45|They then ordered a statewide ban on the hijab in classes. 
Muslim_Students-46|The state's order said religious clothing in government-run schools. 
Muslim_Students-47|Disturbs equality. 
Muslim_Students-48|Integrity and public law and order. 
Muslim_Students-49|Some students gave in and attended with their heads uncovered. 
Muslim_Students-50|Others refused and have been barred from school for nearly two months. 
Muslim_Students-51|One of those students is eighteen-year-old ayesha anwar. 
Muslim_Students-52|From udupi. 
Muslim_Students-53|She said she has missed test and is falling behind in her school work. 
Muslim_Students-54|I feel like we are being let down by everyone. 
Muslim_Students-55|Anwar told the ap. 
Muslim_Students-56|Aisha imtiaz another student barred from school said she wears the hijab as a sign of devotion to islam. 
Muslim_Students-57|But the twenty-year-old noted that opinions differ on the issue even among muslim women. 
Muslim_Students-58|There are so many of my friends who do not wear a hijab inside the classroom. 
Muslim_Students-59|Imtiaz sad. 
Muslim_Students-60|She added. 
Muslim_Students-61|They feel empowered in their own way. 
Muslim_Students-62|And i feel empowered in my own way. 
Muslim_Students-63|I'm brian lynn. 
NASA_Develops-1|The american space agency nasa. 
NASA_Develops-2|Has developed a wearable device to guide future explorers. 
NASA_Develops-3|On the moon. 
NASA_Develops-4|The system is designed to map terrain and guide astronauts through unknown territory and dark areas of the moon. 
NASA_Develops-5|The device can be worn as a backpack. 
NASA_Develops-6|It is called the kinematic navigation and cartography knapsack or knack. 
NASA_Develops-7|The system was specially designed to provide navigation assistance on the moon. 
NASA_Develops-8|Which lacks the kinds of gps systems. 
NASA_Develops-9|That exist on earth. 
NASA_Develops-10|Knack is equipped with a technology called lidar to produce real-time. 
NASA_Develops-11|3d maps. 
NASA_Develops-12|Lidar uses sensors and light lasers to map the surrounding environment. 
NASA_Develops-13|And measure distances. 
NASA_Develops-14|Nasa engineers worked together with private partners to develop the system. 
NASA_Develops-15|One of the partners is ava inc of mountain view california. 
NASA_Develops-16|The company supplied lidar sensors and support for the project. 
NASA_Develops-17|Nasa said. 
NASA_Develops-18|The censors it provided to nasa use a technology known as fmcw. 
NASA_Develops-19|Ava said in a press release. 
NASA_Develops-20|Nasa says the technology can provide. 
NASA_Develops-21|Millions of measurement points per second and create a high-quality map of an area's terrain. 
NASA_Develops-22|The company explained that the sun does not interfere with fmcw technology and it can operate in darkness. 
NASA_Develops-23|This can help astronauts and moon vehicles explore and map the lunar surface. 
NASA_Develops-24|During the day or at night. 
NASA_Develops-25|James river is the vice president of technology at ava. 
NASA_Develops-26|He said the next system will be important to help astronauts carry out critical objectives of nasa's artemis program. 
NASA_Develops-27|Artemis is nasa's program to return humans to the moon. 
NASA_Develops-28|It aims to land american astronauts on the moon by 2025. 
NASA_Develops-29|It would mark the first time humans have visited the moon since nasa's apollo 17 landing in 1972. 
NASA_Develops-30|Michael zanetti leads the neck project at nasa's marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama. 
NASA_Develops-31|He said the device is like a super-powered version of laser-based technologies used in surveying operations and driver assistance tools for vehicles. 
NASA_Develops-32|Zanetti noted that neck can be used by astronauts for both navigation operations and science mapping. 
NASA_Develops-33|It also will help ensure the safety of astronauts and rover vehicles in the gps-denied environment such as the moon. 
NASA_Develops-34|He said. 
NASA_Develops-35|Zanetti added that the system can provide real-time maps to show explores how far they've come and how far is left to go to reach their destination. 
NASA_Develops-36|Nasa also worked with alabama-based torch technologies inc to develop a working model knack backpack. 
NASA_Develops-37|The device has been tested in several settings including at a nasa research center. 
NASA_Develops-38|In kilbourn whole new mexico. 
NASA_Develops-39|The center is used for lunar research because it is near a volcanic crater that contains terrain similar to the moon. 
NASA_Develops-40|The space agency says the device can become an important part of future exploration activities on the moon. 
NASA_Develops-41|This could especially be true for astronaut visits to the moon's south pole. 
NASA_Develops-42|Nasa wants to send explorers to this area. 
NASA_Develops-43|However it receives little sunlight and would be difficult for astronauts to navigate. 
NASA_Develops-44|The development team says it will next work to shrink the size of knack. 
NASA_Develops-45|The current backpack model weighs about 18 kg. 
NASA_Develops-46|The goal is to produce a device that is about the size of a soda container for easy transport ability. 
NASA_Develops-47|Engineers are also working to find ways to protect the devices sensitive electronics system. 
NASA_Develops-48|From the effects of microgravity and radiation that exist in space. 
NASA_Develops-49|I'm brian lynn. 
NASA_Doctor-1|A doctor with the american space agency nasa. 
NASA_Doctor-2|Has made a virtual visit. 
NASA_Doctor-3|To the international space station. 
NASA_Doctor-4|After being teleported by technology. 
NASA_Doctor-5|Doctor yosef schmied. 
NASA_Doctor-6|And several other people took the virtual trip last november. 
NASA_Doctor-7|Nasa recently announced results of the experiment. 
NASA_Doctor-8|The agency said it was the first time that humans had been halo ported from earth to space. 
NASA_Doctor-9|The term holoport is a combination of the words. 
NASA_Doctor-10|Hologram and teleport. 
NASA_Doctor-11|A hologram is an image produced by a computer and made of light. 
NASA_Doctor-12|Hologram objects appear in a shapely form not flat like other images. 
NASA_Doctor-13|Heliport means to travel extra-ordinary fast. 
NASA_Doctor-14|Using special technology. 
NASA_Doctor-15|Such technology does not exist however. 
NASA_Doctor-16|Heliport technology can project. 
NASA_Doctor-17|3d models of people in any environment. 
NASA_Doctor-18|This permits people physically present in the environment. 
NASA_Doctor-19|Toosii. 
NASA_Doctor-20|Here and interact with the halo ported individuals. 
NASA_Doctor-21|The experiment at the iss involved a computer. 
NASA_Doctor-22|Camera and special software developed by nasa and its industry partner ax aerospace. 
NASA_Doctor-23|Special headsets enable people involved. 
NASA_Doctor-24|To interact with one another as if they were in the same shared space. 
NASA_Doctor-25|The camera used was the kinect model made by american software company microsoft. 
NASA_Doctor-26|The camera can be combined with microsoft. 
NASA_Doctor-27|Hololens 2 headset device. 
NASA_Doctor-28|While microsoft has been using holoportation technology for several years. 
NASA_Doctor-29|Nasa said it was the first time it had been used in such an extreme and remote environment. 
NASA_Doctor-30|Such as space. 
NASA_Doctor-31|Similar technology has been used to assist doctors performing remote operations and intel medicine. 
NASA_Doctor-32|Telemedicine is a way for people to talk to doctors and receive health care without having to visit a medical office. 
NASA_Doctor-33|Treatment center. 
NASA_Doctor-34|Or similar place. 
NASA_Doctor-35|Mead described the technology as a completely new manner of human communication across vast distances. 
NASA_Doctor-36|He said the process represents a brand new way of human exploration. 
NASA_Doctor-37|Where are human entity is able to travel off the planet. 
NASA_Doctor-38|During the experiment. 
NASA_Doctor-39|Meade was able to speak with thomas pesky a european space agency astronaut aboard the iss. 
NASA_Doctor-40|Ax aerospace chief fernando dela pena locker and several members of the company's technology team also took part. 
NASA_Doctor-41|In the holoportation event. 
NASA_Doctor-42|Nasa said the technology demonstrates a new form of communication it plans to use on future space missions. 
NASA_Doctor-43|It could permit people on earth. 
NASA_Doctor-44|To be holla ported to space as well as send astronauts on virtual visits to worth. 
NASA_Doctor-45|Mead said the system could be used to hold private medical psychiatric and family meetings. 
NASA_Doctor-46|And to virtually bring important people to the space station. 
NASA_Doctor-47|To visit astronauts. 
NASA_Doctor-48|He added that the next step could be to combine holoportation with augmented reality technology. 
NASA_Doctor-49|Augmented reality or ar. 
NASA_Doctor-50|Is a technology that can project computer created imagery onto headsets like the hololens 2. 
NASA_Doctor-51|The images appear in the headsets along with other physical objects in the environment. 
NASA_Doctor-52|Ar has been used to help guide workers through complex industrial processes. 
NASA_Doctor-53|Imagine you can bring the best instructor or the actual designer of a particularly complex technology. 
NASA_Doctor-54|Right beside you wherever you might be working on it. 
NASA_Doctor-55|Khalid said. 
NASA_Doctor-56|Nasa said holoportation technology could greatly improve future missions into deep space. 
NASA_Doctor-57|It said one of the most important uses could be to provide better and more personal communication between astronauts and people on earth. 
NASA_Doctor-58|The communication could be necessary for medical or mission support reasons. 
NASA_Doctor-59|And it could improve connectivity among astronauts in space. 
NASA_Doctor-60|And their families back home. 
NASA_Doctor-61|But nasa noted one possible challenge that could happen in future planned missions to mars. 
NASA_Doctor-62|Technology systems will have to find a way to effectively operate with communication delays of up to 20 minutes each way during travel to and from mars. 
NASA_Doctor-63|I'm brian lynn. 
Native_Scholars-1|In june 2021. 
Native_Scholars-2|An anonymous report begin to spread. 
Native_Scholars-3|Among canada's university system. 
Native_Scholars-4|E-tax used six professors and employees. 
Native_Scholars-5|At queens college in ontario. 
Native_Scholars-6|Write about their ancestry for personal gain. 
Native_Scholars-7|Queens college is currently overrun with white canadians. 
Native_Scholars-8|Making false claims. 
Native_Scholars-9|To indigenous especially algonquin identity the document reads. 
Native_Scholars-10|As a result. 
Native_Scholars-11|The 64 getting special treatment from the school and should be dismissed from their positions. 
Native_Scholars-12|The report also said that there were other college employees. 
Native_Scholars-13|Who falsely claimed to be native american. 
Native_Scholars-14|Not name any. 
Native_Scholars-15|The college rejected the accusations which led to wider protests. 
Native_Scholars-16|A group of 100 indigenous colors. 
Native_Scholars-17|Quickly condemned queens college in a written statement. 
Native_Scholars-18|The school employees white presented as indigenous professionals who claimed both trauma and shilling that never belonged to them. 
Native_Scholars-19|Argued that the school should require evidence of such claims. 
Native_Scholars-20|Saying some are based on a single old family story or less. 
Native_Scholars-21|The scholars criticized the school for permitting such people to gain. 
Native_Scholars-22|I'm lying about their ancestry and experiences. 
Native_Scholars-23|The protest letter demanded that queens college and all higher education centers. 
Native_Scholars-24|Establish ethical employment guidelines. 
Native_Scholars-25|It said they must include a process. 
Native_Scholars-26|To confirm the ancestry claims of job-seekers. 
Native_Scholars-27|The problem does not stop at the canadian border native americans say. 
Native_Scholars-28|In 2015. 
Native_Scholars-29|Dartmouth college learned that the director of its native american program. 
Native_Scholars-30|Was not a member. 
Native_Scholars-31|Of an officially recognized tribe. 
Native_Scholars-32|The college dismissed the worker from that job. 
Native_Scholars-33|And placed her in another. 
Native_Scholars-34|University of california professor and book writer. 
Native_Scholars-35|Andrea smith. 
Native_Scholars-36|Has said she is native american for many years. 
Native_Scholars-37|Her claim has been debated for almost as long. 
Native_Scholars-38|The new york times wrote a long story about smith and the ancestry issue. 
Native_Scholars-39|Last year. 
Native_Scholars-40|In 2021 reporter jacqueline keeler. 
Native_Scholars-41|Began investigating people who claim to be indigenous. 
Native_Scholars-42|Keeler. 
Native_Scholars-43|A native american. 
Native_Scholars-44|Says she has identified. 
Native_Scholars-45|About 200 people she suspects are frauds. 
Native_Scholars-46|People who say they are something that they are not. 
Native_Scholars-47|Keeler works with tribes. 
Native_Scholars-48|Historians and researchers to uncover truth. 
Native_Scholars-49|In claims of native ancestry. 
Native_Scholars-50|The team examined ancestral evidence from as far back as the 1600s. 
Native_Scholars-51|Then killer produced a list of names of professionals who she says. 
Native_Scholars-52|Falsely claimed to be native. 
Native_Scholars-53|Voa examined the list which includes. 
Native_Scholars-54|Artists writers actors and many university workers. 
Native_Scholars-55|Voa is not publishing the list as it cannot independently confirm what it reports. 
Native_Scholars-56|Some people have criticized keeler for leading. 
Native_Scholars-57|A witch hunt. 
Native_Scholars-58|But she has strong support in need of circles. 
Native_Scholars-59|I don't think jackie intends to do anything with it ben barnes. 
Native_Scholars-60|Chief of the shawnee tribe in oklahoma told voa. 
Native_Scholars-61|Natives have been protesting such fraud in us universities for a long time he said. 
Native_Scholars-62|Adding that he thinks of the list as a place for natives to come together and say. 
Native_Scholars-63|Hey. 
Native_Scholars-64|You're not crazy. 
Native_Scholars-65|Outside of university life many people have tried to profit from false native american identity. 
Native_Scholars-66|That is one reason native americans try to fight against frauds. 
Native_Scholars-67|One well-known actor iron eyes cody. 
Native_Scholars-68|Austin played native americans in movies and television programs. 
Native_Scholars-69|From the 1950s to the 1980s. 
Native_Scholars-70|He was actually italian-american. 
Native_Scholars-71|In the us tribes are considered independent nations that have the right to govern themselves. 
Native_Scholars-72|Most require proof of ancestry to join a tribe. 
Native_Scholars-73|Admission may require knowledge of the tribal language culture and history. 
Native_Scholars-74|Native americans say that people considered frauds. 
Native_Scholars-75|Often make up stories about their ancestors. 
Native_Scholars-76|In march the university of michigan began and online discussion about frauds in media arts politics and education. 
Native_Scholars-77|It was called unsettling genealogies. 
Native_Scholars-78|Kim tallbear. 
Native_Scholars-79|A canadian professor. 
Native_Scholars-80|Took part in the event. 
Native_Scholars-81|She raised special concern about frauds. 
Native_Scholars-82|Who become well-known in their professions. 
Native_Scholars-83|She said. 
Native_Scholars-84|Some become thought leaders. 
Native_Scholars-85|To help the government make policy.

New_Google-1|Google says it has added ways for people to request that some personal information not be included in online search results. 
New_Google-2|In a recent announcement the company said it would now let people request. 
New_Google-3|That's some of their personal details be removed from google searches. 
New_Google-4|Such details could include information like phone numbers. 
New_Google-5|Email and physical addresses. 
New_Google-6|The new policy also permits the removal of information that could aid criminals aiming to steal people's identities. 
New_Google-7|This could include login information used to visit websites. 
New_Google-8|Google said in a statement it believes that open access to information. 
New_Google-9|Is important. 
New_Google-10|But it added privacy and online safety go hand-in-hand. 
New_Google-11|The new policy is empowering people with the tools they need to protect themselves and keep their sensitive. 
New_Google-12|Personal identifiable information private. 
New_Google-13|The statement said. 
New_Google-14|Google had earlier permitted people to request that highly personal details that could cause direct harm be removed. 
New_Google-15|That included information made public. 
New_Google-16|Through a method called doxxing.

New_Google-22|In new ways online. 
New_Google-23|The new policy recognizes that even having basic personal contact information openly available online can present risks. 
New_Google-24|The company said it had received numerous requests for new ways to remove that kind of material as well. 
New_Google-25|Google said when examining individual requests it will study all information on a website to avoid limiting the availability of useful details. 
New_Google-26|This could include information appearing on government or other official websites. 
New_Google-27|In its latest announcement google noted another recent policy change that also aims to protect personal privacy. 
New_Google-28|That policy permits people under age 18 to request the removal of their images. 
New_Google-29|From google search results. 
New_Google-30|But the company's statement warns that information blocked from search results does not mean it cannot be found on the internet. 
New_Google-31|It's important to remember that removing content from google search won't remove it from the internet. 
New_Google-32|The company said. 
New_Google-33|If removing material from the internet is desired people are advised to make a request with the organization that hosts the information.

Omicron_Version-1|From boa learning english. 
Omicron_Version-2|This is the health and lifestyle report. 
Omicron_Version-3|When the covid-19 pandemic hit. 
Omicron_Version-4|Many people around the world. 
Omicron_Version-5|Started spending a lot more time indoors. 
Omicron_Version-6|That's where many so room for improvement. 
Omicron_Version-7|Demand rose sharply for home improvement services and supplies. 
Omicron_Version-8|But people still found ways to make simple changes to improve their home environment. 
Omicron_Version-9|Including adding plant life. 
Omicron_Version-10|2 years into the pandemic the interest and houseplants is still going strong. 
Omicron_Version-11|Social media is helping to make some plans houseplant stars. 
Omicron_Version-12|Plant experts recently talked to the associated press. 
Omicron_Version-13|About the trends in house plans. 
Omicron_Version-14|Which ones were popular. 
Omicron_Version-15|And which ones are becoming more popular. 
Omicron_Version-16|One loser is the cactus. 
Omicron_Version-17|This has been popular over the last 10 years. 
Omicron_Version-18|But now the plant is losing fans. 
Omicron_Version-19|People are now looking for plans that help a home feel warm and loving. 
Omicron_Version-20|The sharp needles of many cactus plans may send a different message. 
Omicron_Version-21|Steadily growing in popularity over the past few years. 
Omicron_Version-22|Is monstera deliciosa. 
Omicron_Version-23|It is also called the split leaf philodendron. 
Omicron_Version-24|Although some experts say monstera deliciosa is not really a philodendron. 
Omicron_Version-25|Another popular plant in the monstera family. 
Omicron_Version-26|Is the swiss cheese plant. 
Omicron_Version-27|Swiss cheese has holes in it. 
Omicron_Version-28|And so do the leaves of this plant. 
Omicron_Version-29|Puneet agarwal is ceo and co-founder of the horty house plant subscription service. 
Omicron_Version-30|He told the ap that. 
Omicron_Version-31|Looks are what make them popular. 
Omicron_Version-32|But he added that some plans that are hard to buy. 
Omicron_Version-33|Also become popular. 
Omicron_Version-34|In the past sippar wall explained. 
Omicron_Version-35|The monsteras were not available in small sizes. 
Omicron_Version-36|And he added they were costly. 
Omicron_Version-37|So hobby gardeners shared clippings small pieces of the plant with each other. 
Omicron_Version-38|Then they would post the plants on instagram with the hashtag monstera monday. 
Omicron_Version-39|This sabherwal said helped to increase the popularity of the plant. 
Omicron_Version-40|These days those plants are easier to buy. 
Omicron_Version-41|The current monstera trend is fueled by its good looks. 
Omicron_Version-42|Social media presence. 
Omicron_Version-43|And ease of care supper walstad. 
Omicron_Version-44|They are hard to kill. 
Omicron_Version-45|And you only need one to add the feel of a jungle to your house. 
Omicron_Version-46|Climbing plants are also popular. 
Omicron_Version-47|Social media sites show images of rooms filled with vines rooted in containers. 
Omicron_Version-48|They spread over furniture. 
Omicron_Version-49|Doorways and other things in the room. 
Omicron_Version-50|Philodendrons are a desirable climbing plant. 
Omicron_Version-51|Hazard large hoya and pothos plants. 
Omicron_Version-52|These are all easy to care for. 
Omicron_Version-53|The beauty of vining plants. 
Omicron_Version-54|Is that you can easily take a clipping and make another sabherwal said. 
Omicron_Version-55|And they do not take up a lot of floor space. 
Omicron_Version-56|Because they grow vertically. 
Omicron_Version-57|Or up and down. 
Omicron_Version-58|Do you like a little drama with your houseplants. 
Omicron_Version-59|If so a carnivorous bug eating plant might be for you. 
Omicron_Version-60|They can be difficult to grow. 
Omicron_Version-61|But they are very interesting to talk about. 
Omicron_Version-62|Damon collingsworth. 
Omicron_Version-63|Is co-owner of california carnivores. 
Omicron_Version-64|It is the largest carnivorous plant store in the us. 
Omicron_Version-65|When we opened in 1989 no one was interested. 
Omicron_Version-66|Because the plants were kind of weird. 
Omicron_Version-67|But he said. 
Omicron_Version-68|Weird is desirable now. 
Omicron_Version-69|Again social media may have played a part. 
Omicron_Version-70|Many tik-tok videos show the plants eating bugs. 
Omicron_Version-71|In september of last year. 
Omicron_Version-72|A video showing a jumping spider living in a pitcher plant. 
Omicron_Version-73|Quickly got 15.8 million views. 
Omicron_Version-74|After it was posted to tik-tok. 
Omicron_Version-75|Traditional gardening organizations have also showed respect. 
Omicron_Version-76|For these quiet green killers. 
Omicron_Version-77|Last summer the yearly bbc gardeners world live. 
Omicron_Version-78|Included a carnivorous plants display for the first time. 
Omicron_Version-79|The event in the british city of birmingham. 
Omicron_Version-80|Has been taking place for 30 years. 
Omicron_Version-81|Collingsworth said his biggest sellers. 
Omicron_Version-82|Are cape sundews. 
Omicron_Version-83|And butterwort. 
Omicron_Version-84|Both are among the easiest carnivorous plants to grow indoors along a sunny window. 
Omicron_Version-85|Tropical pitcher plant are also on trend. 
Omicron_Version-86|But they require more care. 
Omicron_Version-87|Watering them is a balancing act. 
Omicron_Version-88|Collingsworth. 
Omicron_Version-89|Says there's soil should be kept. 
Omicron_Version-90|Slightly wet. 
Omicron_Version-91|But not too wet. 
Omicron_Version-92|And it needs only a short drying. between waterings. 
Omicron_Version-93|These types of plants require mineral free water. 
Omicron_Version-94|Or rainwater. 
Omicron_Version-95|Also they need very little fertilizer. 
Omicron_Version-96|Because they get nutrients from the insects they eat. 
Omicron_Version-97|However when the plants are low on live food supply. 
Omicron_Version-98|Collingsworth suggests adding some fertilizer to each pitcher plants mouth. 
Omicron_Version-99|You can also spray the leaves of other plans with liquid fertilizer. 
Omicron_Version-100|Once a month. 
Omicron_Version-101|They are so different from everything else he said. 
Omicron_Version-102|And also really beautiful. 
Omicron_Version-103|Perhaps because of the pandemic more people need the healing power that nature. 
Omicron_Version-104|Even a small plant. 
Omicron_Version-105|Can provide. 
Omicron_Version-106|Whatever the reasons more and more people are bringing nature into their homes. 
Omicron_Version-107|And that's the health and lifestyle report. 
Omicron_Version-108|I'm on a mateo. 
On_Jupiter-1|Similarities between formations on europa. 
On_Jupiter-2|And a landform in greenland. 
On_Jupiter-3|Suggest jupiter's moon may be able to support life. 
On_Jupiter-4|A study published recently. 
On_Jupiter-5|Compared long landforms called double ridges. 
On_Jupiter-6|On europa's surface. 
On_Jupiter-7|Two similar but smaller landforms and greenland. 
On_Jupiter-8|The double ridges look like huge cuts across europa surface. 
On_Jupiter-9|They have two long mountaintops. 
On_Jupiter-10|And a central valley between them. 
On_Jupiter-11|Stanford university geophysicist riley colburn. 
On_Jupiter-12|Is the lead writer of the study. 
On_Jupiter-13|Published in the publication nature communications. 
On_Jupiter-14|Describing the landforms. 
On_Jupiter-15|He said that if you cut through a double ridge. 
On_Jupiter-16|It would look like a capital m. 
On_Jupiter-17|Radar data showed that refreezing of liquid water below the surface of the ground. 
On_Jupiter-18|Drove the formation of greenland's double ridge. 
On_Jupiter-19|Azure opa's formations were created the same way. 
On_Jupiter-20|It might mean there are large amounts of liquid water near europa's surface. 
On_Jupiter-21|Liquid water is believed to be necessary for life to exist. 
On_Jupiter-22|Europa has gained scientists attention and the past. 
On_Jupiter-23|As a possible place for life outside of earth. 
On_Jupiter-24|That is because research has suggested. 
On_Jupiter-25|That a saltwater ocean is under its ice-covered surface. 
On_Jupiter-26|Smaller areas of water closer to the surface and the double ridges. 
On_Jupiter-27|Would represent as possible please. 
On_Jupiter-28|For small organisms to live. 
On_Jupiter-29|The presence of liquid water in the ice shell. 
On_Jupiter-30|Would suggest that exchange between the ocean. 
On_Jupiter-31|And ice shell is common. 
On_Jupiter-32|Which could be important for chemical cycling. 
On_Jupiter-33|That would help support life. 
On_Jupiter-34|Call bird sad. 
On_Jupiter-35|He added that surface-level water. 
On_Jupiter-36|Would it be easier for future space missions. 
On_Jupiter-37|The study than the deep ocean. 
On_Jupiter-38|The us space agency nasa. 
On_Jupiter-39|Is sending a space vehicle called europa clipper. 
On_Jupiter-40|To jupiter's moon. 
On_Jupiter-41|The launch is planned for 2024. 
On_Jupiter-42|Europa clippers goal is to study if the moon has conditions able to support life. 
On_Jupiter-43|The water in the double ridges. 
On_Jupiter-44|Is within 1 km of the surface. 
On_Jupiter-45|Those areas are near chemicals on the surface. 
On_Jupiter-46|That could support the formation of light. 
On_Jupiter-47|Europa is 3100 km across. 
On_Jupiter-48|A little smaller than earth's moon. 
On_Jupiter-49|But europa's ocean might contain two times the amount of water. 
On_Jupiter-50|That is in earth's oceans. 
On_Jupiter-51|Scientists believe that the first life on earth was small organisms found in the ocean. 
On_Jupiter-52|Europa's double ridges. 
On_Jupiter-53|Are sometimes hundreds of kilometers long. 
On_Jupiter-54|They are 150 to 200 meters tall. 
On_Jupiter-55|And the tops of the ridges are 1/2 to 1 km apart. 
On_Jupiter-56|Scientists have debated how they form. 
On_Jupiter-57|Kohlberg noticed their similarity to a landform. 
On_Jupiter-58|T nail in northwestern greenland. 
On_Jupiter-59|Kohlberg said the greenland double ridge formation. 
On_Jupiter-60|Was created by repeated refreezing. 
On_Jupiter-61|Pressurization. 
On_Jupiter-62|And fracturing of a near-surface body of water. 
On_Jupiter-63|He added that there are two ridges. 
On_Jupiter-64|Because veneer surface water is also split into two bodies. 
On_Jupiter-65|If the same process created europa's double ridges. 
On_Jupiter-66|Each near-surface body of water. 
On_Jupiter-67|Could have as much water as lake erie. 
On_Jupiter-68|One of north america's great lakes. 
On_Jupiter-69|Stanford geophysics professor dustin schroeder helps write the study. 
On_Jupiter-70|She noted that water makes this moon a very exciting candidate for habitability. 
On_Jupiter-71|I'm gregory stoeckel.

One_Year_Later-4|Cases in the united states have doubled in a short.. 
One_Year_Later-5|In december president joe biden announced renewed efforts to get more americans vaccinated and to get booster shots. 
One_Year_Later-6|In addition he announced expanded covid-19 testing. 
One_Year_Later-7|Partly paid for by the government. 
One_Year_Later-8|However he also urged schools to remain open. 
One_Year_Later-9|Biden said more vaccines are available to children and there is federal support for schools. 
One_Year_Later-10|Last year we thought the only way to keep children safe. 
One_Year_Later-11|Was to close their schools. 
One_Year_Later-12|Biden said. 
One_Year_Later-13|Today we know more and we have the tools to keep schools open. 
One_Year_Later-14|What schools are still closing. 
One_Year_Later-15|Burbio is a company that tracks school closures in the us. 
One_Year_Later-16|As of monday afternoon it found 2753 schools.

One_Year_Later-29|8/3 shot of vaccine. 
One_Year_Later-30|The booster shot. 
One_Year_Later-31|Also appears to be effective at fighting off the new version of the coronavirus. 
One_Year_Later-32|In late december the cdc changed its guidelines about quarantining. 
One_Year_Later-33|If someone is infected with the omicron variant. 
One_Year_Later-34|Now those infected with omicron. 
One_Year_Later-35|Are requested to stay isolated for 5 days. 
One_Year_Later-36|Instead of 10 as suggested earlier.

One_Year_Later-38|Students infected with omicron. 
One_Year_Later-39|Would miss just five days of class. 
One_Year_Later-40|The cdc and department of education secretary miguel cardona.

One_Year_Later-49|Said the national association of elementary school principals. 
One_Year_Later-50|In a statement about the cdc guidelines. 
One_Year_Later-51|Even as the pandemic continues to pose new challenges. 
One_Year_Later-52|We must remain laser focused on ensuring students are attending in-person schooling. 
One_Year_Later-53|When it is safe to do so. 
One_Year_Later-54|But some school districts were not prepared for the increase in coronavirus cases. 
One_Year_Later-55|Detroit schools in michigan. 
One_Year_Later-56|Are closed this week through wednesday. 
One_Year_Later-57|To test all school workers for the virus. 
One_Year_Later-58|But students will not be attending online classes. 
One_Year_Later-59|Because some students do not have computers.

Oscar_nominated_Actor-25|I feel like i can die happy with a smile on my face kotzur said. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-26|Cubs road to the oscars began in school. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-27|As a child kotzur loved cartoons like tom and jerry.

Oscar_nominated_Actor-42|Been spoken dialogue. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-43|Kutzer has long been used to seeing simple if not victimized deaf characters. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-44|But the deaf characters of coda are presented differently. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-45|The rosie family in the movie or a family like any other. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-46|Kutzer wants viewers to change their wrong ideas about what deaf people are like.

Oscar_nominated_Actor-59|And i can feel the vibrations of the guitar. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-60|Kopser said. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-61|The first time capsule read the script for coda. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-62|He took it as a warning sign. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-63|He like his character. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-64|Is not ready for his daughter to leave home. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-65|It is these personal connections. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-66|They have made it hard for the actor to separate from the character frank. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-67|It took me about half a year to disconnect from frank he said. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-68|Kutzer has since gone on to appear in the disney plus series the mandalorian. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-69|Dj kurz is the director of death west. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-70|He said kotzur is one of the greats. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-71|We've been waiting for the world to recognize it for some time now. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-72|And it is our hope. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-73|That future deaf actors will not have to wait so long to be recognized on this level. 
Oscar_nominated_Actor-74|Under novak. 
Oyster_Farmers_-1|have you ever seen an ugly oyster
Oyster_Farmers_-2|that is the term oyster farmers use
Oyster_Farmers_-3|for the sea animals
Oyster_Farmers_-4|when their shells get too large to sell to seafood restaurants
Oyster_Farmers_-5|each year Farmers grow oysters
Oyster_Farmers_-6|to just the right size so people at restaurants will enjoy eating them
Oyster_Farmers_-7|if they get too big
Oyster_Farmers_-8|restaurants no longer want to buy them
Oyster_Farmers_-9|so last year when many seafood restaurants in the US closed
Oyster_Farmers_-10|due to the covid-19 pandemic
Oyster_Farmers_-11|oyster Farmers lost the chance to sell their product
Oyster_Farmers_-12|suddenly
Oyster_Farmers_-13|they had a lot of uglies and nothing to do with them
Oyster_Farmers_-14|that was a big problem
Oyster_Farmers_-15|until a conservation program came to the rescue
Oyster_Farmers_-16|the program is called supporting oyster aquaculture and restoration
Oyster_Farmers_-17|or sore
Oyster_Farmers_-18|it is buying more than 5 million oysters
Oyster_Farmers_-19|at the cost of about 2 million dollars
Oyster_Farmers_-20|from Farmers
Oyster_Farmers_-21|on the east coast of the US
Oyster_Farmers_-22|and in Washington State
Oyster_Farmers_-23|Farmers tape living oysters that are too big to sell and send them to places like the Great Bay
Oyster_Farmers_-24|in the northeastern State of New Hampshire
Oyster_Farmers_-25|oysters are placed in the water
Oyster_Farmers_-26|in special locations called reefs
Oyster_Farmers_-27|once they attached to the structures in the water
Oyster_Farmers_-28|they can live for a number of years
Oyster_Farmers_-29|they helped create a good environment for other sea life
Oyster_Farmers_-30|the hope is that the oysters will help clean the water
Oyster_Farmers_-31|and also have babies
Oyster_Farmers_-32|Chris burtis is an oyster Farmer in the state of Maine
Oyster_Farmers_-33|he called the program
Oyster_Farmers_-34|kind of a lifesaver
Oyster_Farmers_-35|Lisa Calvano runs sweet Amalia oyster Farm in Southern New Jersey
Oyster_Farmers_-36|she said the program helped her business get through the pandemic and stay afloat
Oyster_Farmers_-37|an unknown person donated money to the program which was organised by the Pew charitable trusts and The Nature Conservancy
Oyster_Farmers_-38|the group's work together with the US Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
Oyster_Farmers_-39|which ran similar programs in other parts of the US
Oyster_Farmers_-40|calvo started her Farm about 20 years ago
Oyster_Farmers_-41|she sells her oysters to restaurants close to Philadelphia Pennsylvania
Oyster_Farmers_-42|and those in the towns along the ocean in New Jersey
Oyster_Farmers_-43|oysters are ready to sell when they are about 2 years old
Oyster_Farmers_-44|when all the restaurants started closing
Oyster_Farmers_-45|she said
Oyster_Farmers_-46|she was in a panic
Oyster_Farmers_-47|basically you know my eggs were in that restaurant basket
Oyster_Farmers_-48|she was able to earn about half the usual amount of money
Oyster_Farmers_-49|by selling her oysters to the program
Oyster_Farmers_-50|that was better than nothing
Oyster_Farmers_-51|the program helped her pay her employees and get ready for the next stir season
Oyster_Farmers_-52|the money allowed her to grow oysters that she could sell this year when prices returned to normal
Oyster_Farmers_-53|she said working to keep the large oysters healthy
Oyster_Farmers_-54|when they could not be sold would have hurt her business
Oyster_Farmers_-55|and she could not give up on the young or sisters either
Oyster_Farmers_-56|it wasn't like I could just walk away from the farm
Oyster_Farmers_-57|because it's there so much intensive labor
Oyster_Farmers_-58|particularly during the spring and summer is the Twisters are growing
Oyster_Farmers_-59|rapidly
Oyster_Farmers_-60|you can't just walk away from an oyster farm and come back when the markets good again
Oyster_Farmers_-61|calvo is not just an oyster farmer
Oyster_Farmers_-62|before she started her Farm she studied ocean science
Oyster_Farmers_-63|she said the program should restore the reefs and help oysters and other sea animals
Oyster_Farmers_-64|oysters can live for five to six years
Oyster_Farmers_-65|so they will produce young oysters for many more years
Oyster_Farmers_-66|that is important
Oyster_Farmers_-67|The Nature Conservancy says there are 85%
Oyster_Farmers_-68|fewer oyster reefs than in the past due to disease pollution
Oyster_Farmers_-69|and overfishing
Oyster_Farmers_-70|similar smaller programs
Oyster_Farmers_-71|we're successful in the past in the ocean off the coast of New Hampshire
Oyster_Farmers_-72|Raymond Grizzle
Oyster_Farmers_-73|is a professor
Oyster_Farmers_-74|at the University of New Hampshire
Oyster_Farmers_-75|he studies oysters
Oyster_Farmers_-76|he said the project is a good experiment
Oyster_Farmers_-77|we are hoping for the best
Oyster_Farmers_-78|it's almost a sure thing
Oyster_Farmers_-79|that they are going to do some good he said
Oyster_Farmers_-80|calvo said the program helps her during a bad time but the business lessons she learned during the pandemic
Oyster_Farmers_-81|should help her in the future
Oyster_Farmers_-82|now she is able to sell oysters directly to customers who come to her Farm
Oyster_Farmers_-83|she also sells items from other producers in her area
Oyster_Farmers_-84|I almost wish I had planted more oysters last year she said right now
Oyster_Farmers_-85|the restaurants haven't even fully open yet
Oyster_Farmers_-86|and they're already ordering more oysters
Oyster_Farmers_-87|then they ever have

Plant_Native_Plants-1|Birthday is april 22nd. 
Plant_Native_Plants-2|Every year people around the world observe the day. 
Plant_Native_Plants-3|By helping to care for the environment. 
Plant_Native_Plants-4|They carry out all kinds of activities in an effort to better the planets health. 
Plant_Native_Plants-5|One way to support this goal. 
Plant_Native_Plants-6|Is to grow plants native to your area. 
Plant_Native_Plants-7|This helps wildlife like birds and insects. 
Plant_Native_Plants-8|That evolved alongside native plants. 
Plant_Native_Plants-9|For many of these animals. 
Plant_Native_Plants-10|Plant pollen is there food. 
Plant_Native_Plants-11|Native pollinators often cannot recognize non-native plants as food. 
Plant_Native_Plants-12|This means they do not collect the pollen or spread plants seeds. 
Plant_Native_Plants-13|Planting non-native species create so-called food deserts for pollinators including bees birds bats butterflies and more. 
Plant_Native_Plants-14|Doug tallamy is a professor of entomology at the university of delaware. 
Plant_Native_Plants-15|Entomology is the study of insects. 
Plant_Native_Plants-16|He found that non-native plant species can harm the natural food chain. 
Plant_Native_Plants-17|Which can lead to a collapse of the environment. 
Plant_Native_Plants-18|Plants choice matters he said. 
Plant_Native_Plants-19|The plants we choose to landscape our properties with. 
Plant_Native_Plants-20|Should be determined by how much life can live there. 
Plant_Native_Plants-21|Humans depend strongly on insects. 
Plant_Native_Plants-22|Without them we would have no flowering plants which would harm the food web that supports important animals. 
Plant_Native_Plants-23|Birds for example depend on plants for food. 
Plant_Native_Plants-24|And spread their seeds while keeping the populations of harmful insects down. 
Plant_Native_Plants-25|Insects support plants that provide oxygen. 
Plant_Native_Plants-26|Clean our water. 
Plant_Native_Plants-27|Capture carbon and add nutrients to the soil. 
Plant_Native_Plants-28|That builds topsoil and prevent flooding. 
Plant_Native_Plants-29|Without insects the biosphere. 
Plant_Native_Plants-30|The living parts of the earth. 
Plant_Native_Plants-31|Wood rot because of the loss of insect decomposers. 
Plant_Native_Plants-32|Humans simply could not survive that. 
Plant_Native_Plants-33|Ptolemy said. 
Plant_Native_Plants-34|In addition to providing food and habitat. 
Plant_Native_Plants-35|For insects and other wildlife. 
Plant_Native_Plants-36|Native plants are able to grow easily and do not require much care. 
Plant_Native_Plants-37|That means less watering and less fertilizing. 
Plant_Native_Plants-38|The situation is a win-win for gardeners and pollinators. 
Plant_Native_Plants-39|I'm ashley thompson.

Popular_Houseplants-1|American researchers say they tested a group of deer in new york city. 
Popular_Houseplants-2|And found that some of them were infected with the omicron version of covid-19. 
Popular_Houseplants-3|The highly infectious version or variant. 
Popular_Houseplants-4|Was identified in the white-tailed deer population. 
Popular_Houseplants-5|On the city's staten island. 
Popular_Houseplants-6|The omicron variant was found in seven of the 68 deer tested. 
Popular_Houseplants-7|Between december 13th. 
Popular_Houseplants-8|And january 31st. 
Popular_Houseplants-9|The results are reported in a study carried out by researchers at penn state university in pennsylvania. 
Popular_Houseplants-10|The study was financed by the united states department of agriculture. 
Popular_Houseplants-11|Or usda. 
Popular_Houseplants-12|Earlier covid-19 variants were also found in white-tailed deer in new york. 
Popular_Houseplants-13|And several other us states. 
Popular_Houseplants-14|But the staten island study is the first. 
Popular_Houseplants-15|To find evidence of the omicron variant. 
Popular_Houseplants-16|In deer or any other animal population. 
Popular_Houseplants-17|Said suresh kuchipudi. 
Popular_Houseplants-18|He is a professor of neurology at penn state. 
Popular_Houseplants-19|Who led the research team. 
Popular_Houseplants-20|Kuchipudi told the associated press. 
Popular_Houseplants-21|The finding opened up the possibility. 
Popular_Houseplants-22|That like the previous variants. 
Popular_Houseplants-23|Omicron can and has spilled over into animals. 
Popular_Houseplants-24|He added that for this reason the presence of covid-19 in animal populations. 
Popular_Houseplants-25|Needs to be closely watched. 
Popular_Houseplants-26|Kuchipudi added that the spillover of omicron from humans to deer. 
Popular_Houseplants-27|Suggest the possibility that vaccine resistant versions of the virus. 
Popular_Houseplants-28|Could mutate. 
Popular_Houseplants-29|And spread in non-humans. 
Popular_Houseplants-30|When the virus completely mutates then it can escape the protection of the current vaccine. 
Popular_Houseplants-31|Kuchipudi sad. 
Popular_Houseplants-32|So we'd have to change the vaccine again. 
Popular_Houseplants-33|The researchers also reported that nearly 15% of the 131 deer captured on staten island. 
Popular_Houseplants-34|Had covid-19 antibodies. 
Popular_Houseplants-35|This finding suggests that the animals had passed coronavirus infections. 
Popular_Houseplants-36|And they were re-infected with new variants. 
Popular_Houseplants-37|In august the usda said it found the world's first cases of covid-19 in wild deer in ohio.

Proposed_Living-1|A research center has found that students learning english as a second language. 
Proposed_Living-2|Or eso. 
Proposed_Living-3|Struggled during the coronavirus health crisis. 
Proposed_Living-4|Last month the wida consortium. 
Proposed_Living-5|A research group based at the university of wisconsin. 
Proposed_Living-6|Released a study on esl students. 
Proposed_Living-7|It found english proficiency and growth in english studies. 
Proposed_Living-8|Decreased during the 2020 2021 school year. 
Proposed_Living-9|Wida provides standardized tests to english learners in 36 states. 
Proposed_Living-10|State and federal law requires esl students to be tested from kindergarten through 12th grade. 
Proposed_Living-11|The wida test is used to find out. 
Proposed_Living-12|If a student should remain in esl classroom. 
Proposed_Living-13|Or join the general student population. 
Proposed_Living-14|Scores in many areas of english proficiency. 
Proposed_Living-15|Reading speaking listening and writing. 
Proposed_Living-16|Decreased during the last school year. 
Proposed_Living-17|The biggest decreases where in speaking. 
Proposed_Living-18|Students in the elementary and middle school grades. 
Proposed_Living-19|Showed the biggest decreases. 
Proposed_Living-20|While high school students improved. 
Proposed_Living-21|In areas like listening and reading. 
Proposed_Living-22|Educators and school officials. 
Proposed_Living-23|Say that online class has made it more difficult for esl students. 
Proposed_Living-24|To use english. 
Proposed_Living-25|When it was not spoken at home. 
Proposed_Living-26|Students did not have a full day of schooling in english online. 
Proposed_Living-27|Send destiny edwards. 
Proposed_Living-28|She is the assistant superintendent of austin independent school district in texas. 
Proposed_Living-29|But she expects student performance to improve this year now that classes are returning to normal. 
Proposed_Living-30|There were some limits to the weta data however. 
Proposed_Living-31|Wida required its test to be taken in person. 
Proposed_Living-32|Even in districts where classes were online. 
Proposed_Living-33|That may have been the reason why 30% fewer students took the wida test in 2021. 
Proposed_Living-34|Then in 2019 and 2020. 
Proposed_Living-35|Because of the pandemic students were also tested at a regular times. 
Proposed_Living-36|Instead of being tested every 12 months. 
Proposed_Living-37|Students took the test between 9 and 15 months apart. 
Proposed_Living-38|And students who took the test one year. 
Proposed_Living-39|Might not have taken the test again. 
Proposed_Living-40|The total number of students in the study was also low said leslie villegas. 
Proposed_Living-41|She is with the new america foundation a public policy research group in washington dc. 
Proposed_Living-42|Students from texas california and new york. 
Proposed_Living-43|Do not take the wida test and are not included in the data. 
Proposed_Living-44|However those three states have the highest numbers of esl students. 
Proposed_Living-45|Villegas said the study provides some useful information. 
Proposed_Living-46|But that educators should be careful about forming opinions from it. 
Proposed_Living-47|The information is definitely not representative of all english learners in the country. 
Proposed_Living-48|Diego said. 
Proposed_Living-49|I think we need to keep that in mind. 
Proposed_Living-50|Students may not have been in a good academic position before the pandemic either she said. 
Proposed_Living-51|Finding good quality information on english learners educational progress has been difficult throughout the pandemic. 
Proposed_Living-52|Diego said. 
Proposed_Living-53|For example edwards said there is a gap in data about esl learners performance and participation rates in austin. 
Proposed_Living-54|While texas has a statewide tests to measure performance. 
Proposed_Living-55|The test was not required for all students last year. 
Proposed_Living-56|I would not use 2021 test data to say. 
Proposed_Living-57|Oh. 
Proposed_Living-58|This is where we're going as a nation. 
Proposed_Living-59|Other than to see if it aligns with something that we have some evidence of locally. 
Proposed_Living-60|Christina robertson told the publication education week. 
Proposed_Living-61|Robertson is the head of esl program. 
Proposed_Living-62|At roseville area schools in minnesota. 
Proposed_Living-63|Villegas said states should look at their own test scores. 
Proposed_Living-64|And information. 
Proposed_Living-65|To find out where to place their resources to best serve their students. 
Proposed_Living-66|The onus is not on students she said. 
Proposed_Living-67|The onus is on the system to figure out where the need is. 
Proposed_Living-68|And targets resources and attention. 
Proposed_Living-69|And support to those areas. 
Proposed_Living-70|I'm doing over there. 
Publisher-1|I donation by a famous writer has helped start an effort.

Publisher-13|She said in a statement. 
Publisher-14|That in many communities. 
Publisher-15|People do not have enough money to buy books. 
Publisher-16|So. 
Publisher-17|She said her company. 
Publisher-18|Needed to come up with an alternative to our tried-and-true model. 
Publisher-19|Because every child needs to be able to choose and own books. 
Publisher-20|And see themselves. 
Publisher-21|As a reader. 
Publisher-22|Scholastic is a large publisher of books for children. 
Publisher-23|And educational materials. 
Publisher-24|Its goal is to get books into schools. 
Publisher-25|To increase literacy. 
Publisher-26|The company has publishing rights in the us.

Publisher-31|He is credited with selling millions of books. 
Publisher-32|He has already donated more than $10 to teachers and students. 
Publisher-33|Through scholastic. 
Publisher-34|He said in a statement. 
Publisher-35|That he has supported literacy for many years. 
Publisher-36|He believes reading skills are important. 
Publisher-37|For the country. 
Publisher-38|In many cases kids simply need access to books. 
Publisher-39|And especially books they want to read. 
Publisher-40|To fall in love with reading. 
Publisher-41|Characters. 
Publisher-42|And stories. 
Publisher-43|Patterson added. 
Publisher-44|That the program will bring books to those schools and communities. 
Publisher-45|That need them the most. 
Publisher-46|And ones that we haven't served. 
Publisher-47|Before. 
Publisher-48|Scholastic describes the program on its website. 
Publisher-49|It says the united states of readers program. 
Publisher-50|Target's children in schools. 
Publisher-51|Serving poor communities that receive federal educational money. 
Publisher-52|The company said. 
Publisher-53|It has chosen a limited number of schools to take part this year. 
Publisher-54|But hopes to expand the program in the coming years. 
Publisher-55|I'm mario ritter junior. 
Puppies_Trained-1|The covid-19 pandemic. 
Puppies_Trained-2|Has been difficult on many groups of people. 
Puppies_Trained-3|But perhaps it has been especially hard. 
Puppies_Trained-4|For many older people. 
Puppies_Trained-5|Many months of being alone or isolated. 
Puppies_Trained-6|Has taken its toll on many senior citizens. 
Puppies_Trained-7|However in some places. 
Puppies_Trained-8|That isolation is coming to an end. 
Puppies_Trained-9|For example. 
Puppies_Trained-10|In a senior center in new york city. 
Puppies_Trained-11|Seniors shake their hips and stomp their feet. 
Puppies_Trained-12|To salsa cha-cha and merengue music. 
Puppies_Trained-13|After two years of living in covid-19 pandemic isolation. 
Puppies_Trained-14|Latin dance classes are getting them moving together again. 
Puppies_Trained-15|Despite illness and mobility issues. 
Puppies_Trained-16|Including the loss of a leg. 
Puppies_Trained-17|Students are now able to take three classes. 
Puppies_Trained-18|At the y m and ywha of washington heights and inwood in upper manhattan. 
Puppies_Trained-19|The dance instructor is fifty-year-old walter perez. 
Puppies_Trained-20|He and his partner and argentinian tango dancer. 
Puppies_Trained-21|Started the hour-long class in 2013. 
Puppies_Trained-22|Their goal was to teach latin social dances at senior centers. 
Puppies_Trained-23|Pro said we saw how our students got happier and improved their physical balance and they socialized. 
Puppies_Trained-24|Perez told reporters from reuters news agency. 
Puppies_Trained-25|That the classes start with seated exercises. 
Puppies_Trained-26|This way everyone even those who have trouble moving. 
Puppies_Trained-27|Can be included. 
Puppies_Trained-28|And then he added we stand up. 
Puppies_Trained-29|And we danced a little bit. 
Puppies_Trained-30|One of the students is felix castillo. 
Puppies_Trained-31|Last year his leg was amputated due to complications from diabetes. 
Puppies_Trained-32|The 74-year old trumpet player said. 
Puppies_Trained-33|I get emotional and need to dance when i hear salsa. 
Puppies_Trained-34|He said he feels the music and dances in his chair. 
Puppies_Trained-35|Despite dementia. 
Puppies_Trained-36|Eugenia peralta. 
Puppies_Trained-37|Cannot help but dance around the room. 
Puppies_Trained-38|The 89 year-old is known for her energetic moves on the dance floor. 
Puppies_Trained-39|For this her fellow dancers call her roadrunner. 
Puppies_Trained-40|Said her daughter jackie peralta. 
Puppies_Trained-41|A roadrunner is known to be a fast-moving animal. 
Puppies_Trained-42|Covid took a toll on her. 
Puppies_Trained-43|Her mobility went down said jackie. 
Puppies_Trained-44|But now her mother is active. 
Puppies_Trained-45|In fact jackie said her mother has a hard time staying still in one place. 
Puppies_Trained-46|Walter perez the instructor said that when in-person classes started. 
Puppies_Trained-47|After nearly a year's break. 
Puppies_Trained-48|The stamina. 
Puppies_Trained-49|Of the senior students was not the same. 
Puppies_Trained-50|He said many were missing. 
Puppies_Trained-51|So it was very sad. 
Puppies_Trained-52|But we were happy to be here and to come back. 
Puppies_Trained-53|To have this courage to keep going. 
Puppies_Trained-54|What drives perez is the pleasure of dance. 
Puppies_Trained-55|He found this relationship with dance at age 21. 
Puppies_Trained-56|That was when his mother died. 
Puppies_Trained-57|I went to the church to pray. 
Puppies_Trained-58|Next to the church in argentina. 
Puppies_Trained-59|There was a tango place. 
Puppies_Trained-60|So i started dancing tango. 
Puppies_Trained-61|And it was therapeutic for me. 
Puppies_Trained-62|And then became my profession. 
Puppies_Trained-63|And my way of living. 
Puppies_Trained-64|He added that the music and dance have a healing therapeutic effect on people. 
Puppies_Trained-65|He likens it to an embrace. 
Puppies_Trained-66|When the music is playing and you are dancing with others. 
Puppies_Trained-67|You are not alone. 
Puppies_Trained-68|You are walking with the music in an embrace. 
Puppies_Trained-69|I'm on a mateo.

Rescuers_Seek_S-1|rescue workers still hope to find survivors of the collapse of a large condominium building on an island community
Rescuers_Seek_S-2|Miami Florida on Thursday
Rescuers_Seek_S-3|officials now say 10 people have died
Rescuers_Seek_S-4|but more than 150 remain missing
Rescuers_Seek_S-5|families of the missing have taken buses to an area nearby to watch the rescue effort
Rescuers_Seek_S-6|which includes using heavy equipment
Rescuers_Seek_S-7|such as cranes
Rescuers_Seek_S-8|rescue workers are using dogs and high-technology devices
Rescuers_Seek_S-9|in an effort to find people
Rescuers_Seek_S-10|trapped in the wreckage and concrete
Rescuers_Seek_S-11|but the search has been slowed by rain and a fire
Rescuers_Seek_S-12|we have over 80 Rescuers at a time that are breaching the walls that collapse
Rescuers_Seek_S-13|Chad Andy Alvarez on National Television
Rescuers_Seek_S-14|he is a commander with Miami-Dade Fire Rescue
Rescuers_Seek_S-15|he said workers are looking in spaces left by the collapsed floors and walls
Rescuers_Seek_S-16|we have been able to Tunnel through the building
Rescuers_Seek_S-17|this is a frantic search to seek that hope
Rescuers_Seek_S-18|that Miracle to see who we can bring out of this building alive
Rescuers_Seek_S-19|Alfredo Lopez lived with his wife on the 6th floor of the building
Rescuers_Seek_S-20|they escaped
Rescuers_Seek_S-21|but he said it was hard to believe that anyone could have survived the collapse
Rescuers_Seek_S-22|if you saw what I saw nothingness
Rescuers_Seek_S-23|and then you go over there and do see like all the rebel
Rescuers_Seek_S-24|how can somebody survive that
Rescuers_Seek_S-25|love has told the Associated Press
Rescuers_Seek_S-26|Rescuers are using tools such as a microwave radar device developed by NASA's jet propulsion Laboratory
Rescuers_Seek_S-27|and the Department of Homeland Security
Rescuers_Seek_S-28|the chief of the company that sells the device
Rescuers_Seek_S-29|said it is able to see through up to 20 cm of solid concrete
Rescuers_Seek_S-30|it can also listen for human breathing and heartbeats
Rescuers_Seek_S-31|the collapse happened days before people living in the building work to start making payments toward a 9 million-dollar repair project
Rescuers_Seek_S-32|three years earlier a report had warned of major structural damage to the building which is in the Island Town of Surfside
Rescuers_Seek_S-33|six to eight teens are searching the partially collapsed building at any given time
Rescuers_Seek_S-34|hundreds of people are involved in the effort
Rescuers_Seek_S-35|which started on Thursday and has not stopped since
Rescuers_Seek_S-36|Earl Tilton is a search-and-rescue expert from North Carolina
Rescuers_Seek_S-37|he warned that moving too fast without careful planning
Rescuers_Seek_S-38|can be very dangerous for Rescuers
Rescuers_Seek_S-39|moving the wrong piece of debris at the wrong time could cause it to fall
Rescuers_Seek_S-40|endangering workers he said
Rescuers_Seek_S-41|Tilton added that there was still hope of finding people alive

Researchers_Explore-1|Drug companies are testing new methods to improve the efficacy of covid-19 vaccines using combination shots or nasal drops. 
Researchers_Explore-2|They hope the continued research will help strengthen resistance to a continuously changing coronavirus. 
Researchers_Explore-3|The first covid-19 vaccines remain protective against serious sickness. 
Researchers_Explore-4|Hospitalization and death. 
Researchers_Explore-5|Especially after a booster dose. 
Researchers_Explore-6|However. 
Researchers_Explore-7|Drug companies are facing growing pressure to develop vaccines better at fighting off milder infections. 
Researchers_Explore-8|Updating vaccines to match the latest variances risky. 
Researchers_Explore-9|Because future variance could be very different. 
Researchers_Explore-10|So. 
Researchers_Explore-11|Companies are considering something like a flu vaccine. 
Researchers_Explore-12|Which offers protection against three or four different strains in one shot every year. 
Researchers_Explore-13|Moderne in pfizer are testing two-in-one covid-19 protection that they hope to offer this fall. 
Researchers_Explore-14|Each bivalent shot would mix the original proven vaccine with an omicron targeted version. 
Researchers_Explore-15|Moderne has some early evidence that the idea could work. 
Researchers_Explore-16|It tested the combination shots that targeted the original version of the virus and an earlier variant named beta. 
Researchers_Explore-17|It found vaccine recipients developed limited levels of antibodies capable of fighting not just pay.. 
Researchers_Explore-18|But also newer variants like omicron. 
Researchers_Explore-19|Moderne now is testing its omicron targeted by valent candidate. 
Researchers_Explore-20|Dr. david kimberlin icdc advisor from the university of alabama at birmingham. 
Researchers_Explore-21|Recently suggested that for the average person. 
Researchers_Explore-22|Two doses of the pfizer or moderna vaccine plus one booster. 
Researchers_Explore-23|A total of 3 shots. 
Researchers_Explore-24|Gets you set up and ready for what may become a yearly booster. 
Researchers_Explore-25|After that first booster. 
Researchers_Explore-26|Cdc data suggests an additional dose offers most people a small. 
Researchers_Explore-27|Temporary benefit. 
Researchers_Explore-28|Experts recommend three shots because vaccination triggers development of antibodies that can fight off coronavirus infection. 
Researchers_Explore-29|Such antibody levels naturally decrease over time. 
Researchers_Explore-30|But memory cells jump into action to make new virus fighters if an infection sneaks in. 
Researchers_Explore-31|Rockefeller university researchers. 
Researchers_Explore-32|Found those memory cells may become stronger and able to target more diverse kinds of the virus. 
Researchers_Explore-33|After the third shot. 
Researchers_Explore-34|Even if someone who is vaccinated gets milder infection. 
Researchers_Explore-35|Memory cells still help give time to protect you against severe illness. 
Researchers_Explore-36|Set dr. paul office. 
Researchers_Explore-37|Of the children's hospital of philadelphia. 
Researchers_Explore-38|But some people. 
Researchers_Explore-39|Those with severely weakened immune systems. 
Researchers_Explore-40|Need more doses are leon for a better chance of protection. 
Researchers_Explore-41|Americans 50 and older are being offered a second booster. 
Researchers_Explore-42|Following similar decisions by israel and other countries. 
Researchers_Explore-43|That offer the extra shot to give older people a little more protection. 
Researchers_Explore-44|The cdc is developing advice to help those eligible. 
Researchers_Explore-45|Decide whether to get an extra shot now or wait. 
Researchers_Explore-46|Among those who might want the second booster sooner are the elderly. 
Researchers_Explore-47|People with health problems. 
Researchers_Explore-48|Or people who are at high risk of exposure from work or travel. 
Researchers_Explore-49|It is hard for a shot in the arm to form lots of virus-fighting antibodies inside the nose where the coronavirus latches on. 
Researchers_Explore-50|But a nasal vaccine might offer a new way to prevent infections. 
Researchers_Explore-51|When i think about what would make me get the second booster. 
Researchers_Explore-52|I actually would want to prevent infection. 
Researchers_Explore-53|Said dr gracely of stanford university. 
Researchers_Explore-54|Two chairs cdc immunization advisory committee. 
Researchers_Explore-55|I think we need to do better. 
Researchers_Explore-56|Nasal vaccines are difficult to develop. 
Researchers_Explore-57|And it is not clear how quickly any could become available. 
Researchers_Explore-58|But several are in clinical trials around the world. 
Researchers_Explore-59|One in late-stage testing. 
Researchers_Explore-60|Made by india's bharat biotech. 
Researchers_Explore-61|Uses a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver a harmless copy of coronavirus spike protein to the lining of the nose. 
Researchers_Explore-62|I certainly do not want to abandon the success we have had with covid-19 shots. 
Researchers_Explore-63|Set dr. michael diamond of washington university in st louis. 
Researchers_Explore-64|Diamond helped create the candidate that has no license. 
Researchers_Explore-65|Two bahara. 
Researchers_Explore-66|But we're going to have a difficult time stopping transmission with the current vaccines diamond added. 
Researchers_Explore-67|We have all learned that.

Researchers_Look-1|Researchers are looking into the biological causes of stuttering. 
Researchers_Look-2|Stuttering is a speech problem that causes the speaker to repeat the beginning sound of some words. 
Researchers_Look-3|For centuries. 
Researchers_Look-4|People have feared being judged for stuttering. 
Researchers_Look-5|It is a condition often misunderstood as a psychological problem. 
Researchers_Look-6|Caused by things like bad parenting or emotional trauma. 
Researchers_Look-7|But research presented at a recent science conference. 
Researchers_Look-8|Explores its biological causes. 
Researchers_Look-9|Genetics and brain differences. 
Researchers_Look-10|Stuttering effect 70 million people around the world including us president joe biden. 
Researchers_Look-11|Fighting has spoken publicly about being bullied by classmates. 
Researchers_Look-12|For his speech problem. 
Researchers_Look-13|He has said that overcoming his stutter was one of the hardest things he ever did. 
Researchers_Look-14|After a campaign event in 2020. 
Researchers_Look-15|Emits a new hampshire teenager who also studdard. 
Researchers_Look-16|Braden harrington. 
Researchers_Look-17|They ended up talking for an hour. 
Researchers_Look-18|Living with a stutter has not been easy. 
Researchers_Look-19|Braden told the associated press. 
Researchers_Look-20|I want to carry on what joe biden said to me he said. 
Researchers_Look-21|That this does not define you. 
Researchers_Look-22|And that you can be much more than you see yourself as. 
Researchers_Look-23|Stuttering has been recorded as far back as ancient china. 
Researchers_Look-24|Greece and rome. 
Researchers_Look-25|But no one really knew what caused it. 
Researchers_Look-26|Until modern genetic science and brain imaging helped provide some answers. 
Researchers_Look-27|Researchers identified the first genes strongly linked to stuttering more than a decade ago. 
Researchers_Look-28|Imaging studies looked at brains of adults and older children. 
Researchers_Look-29|And in the last few years. 
Researchers_Look-30|University of delaware researcher ho ming chow. 
Researchers_Look-31|Started looking at three to five year olds. 
Researchers_Look-32|That is around the age many kids begin stuttering. 
Researchers_Look-33|With about 80% outgrowing it. 
Researchers_Look-34|Show said the imaging shows small brain differences in young children who keep stuttering. 
Researchers_Look-35|Compared with those who recover. 
Researchers_Look-36|Or those who never studdard. 
Researchers_Look-37|He discussed his research earlier this month. 
Researchers_Look-38|At a conference of the american association for the advancement of science. 
Researchers_Look-39|For example. 
Researchers_Look-40|Chow and his team found that genetic mutations related to stuttering. 
Researchers_Look-41|Orleans to structural problems in the corpus callosum. 
Researchers_Look-42|And fell emissaries of the brain. 
Researchers_Look-43|The corpus callosum is an area that connects the two sides of the brain. 
Researchers_Look-44|It helps them communicate. 
Researchers_Look-45|The thalamus sends sensory information to other parts of the brain. 
Researchers_Look-46|Past research. 
Researchers_Look-47|Has also linked stuttering to the basal ganglia. 
Researchers_Look-48|A group of brain structures involved in body movements. 
Researchers_Look-49|Though several genes may be involved and the exact genetic causes may vary by child. 
Researchers_Look-50|They probably affect the brain in a similar way. 
Researchers_Look-51|Trout said. 
Researchers_Look-52|Still many people incorrectly believe that people stutter because they are nervous. 
Researchers_Look-53|We're suffered childhood trauma. 
Researchers_Look-54|Some also think stutters could stop if they just tried harder. 
Researchers_Look-55|We have a long way to go to change such beliefs. 
Researchers_Look-56|Said university of maryland researcher nan bernstein ratner. 
Researchers_Look-57|Speech therapy is currently the main way to treat stuttering. 
Researchers_Look-58|But the medications now being tested. 
Researchers_Look-59|Could be approved for stuttering in the next few years. 
Researchers_Look-60|Studies have suggested that stuttering may be related to high levels of a chemical in the brain called dopamine. 
Researchers_Look-61|Some medicines reduce dopamine activity. 
Researchers_Look-62|Or block its action. 
Researchers_Look-63|Holly nova is a speech pathologist and member of the national stuttering association. 
Researchers_Look-64|She grew up trying to hide her stutter. 
Researchers_Look-65|Her ten-year-old son colton also has a speech problem. 
Researchers_Look-66|She said many people will surely be interested in trying stuttering medications. 
Researchers_Look-67|But not her. 
Researchers_Look-68|She is happy with her life as it is. 
Researchers_Look-69|And says she has accepted her stuttering. 
Researchers_Look-70|Is colton were struggling and wanted to try medication as a teenager however. 
Researchers_Look-71|She would be open to the idea. 
Researchers_Look-72|Braden who is now fourteen does not plan to try medication. 
Researchers_Look-73|Taking medicine is just taking away a part of you. 
Researchers_Look-74|Taking away part of your personality you said. 
Researchers_Look-75|I'm down novak.

Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-9|known as Crusaders
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-10|buried the 13 bronze Bells near the church
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-11|because they were worried that the instruments might be destroyed
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-12|they covered the instruments in animal fat
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-13|to protect them from rust

Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-16|with early research complete
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-17|he estimates it will take about five years
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-18|to make fully usable copies
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-19|meanwhile

Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-24|it's half of the original sound
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-25|which was much richer and louder and a little bit lower
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-26|Catalunya said
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-27|the bells were part of a set that played while people sang inside the church
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-28|said Franciscan Friar father Stephen
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-29|the custody is liturgist
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-30|a liturgist leads church members in ritual prayer
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-31|the bells were discovered in the early 20th century

Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-37|The Collection also includes the scepter of the bishop of Bethlehem and candlesticks from the 12th century which Catalonia said
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-38|or made in France
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-39|this suggests a shared source with the bells and organ pipes
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-40|which father's defenses are the oldest in Christendom

Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-42|and played
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-43|at a Jerusalem Museum the custody plans do open by 2024
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-44|he used the term significant

Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-46|when talking about the Bells
Researchers_Recreate_Ancient_Instruments-47|these bells are very significant for us

SAT-1|The united states supreme court. 
SAT-2|Has agreed to review a legal effort. 
SAT-3|Inhumane to overturn. 
SAT-4|The consideration of race in college admissions. 
SAT-5|The court's ruling could affect. 
SAT-6|Affirmative action policies. 
SAT-7|Used to increase diversity. 
SAT-8|At american colleges. 
SAT-9|Affirmative action is a set of policies. 
SAT-10|Designed to end unlawful discrimination. 
SAT-11|It is also used to help people in a group that has been discriminated against in the past. 
SAT-12|The nation's highest court said monday that it will hear the appeal by a group called. 
SAT-13|Students for fair admissions. 
SAT-14|Sffa. 
SAT-15|Against harvard university and the university of north carolina at chapel hill. 
SAT-16|The group is founded by edward bloom. 
SAT-17|He has worked for many years to fight against racial consideration. 
SAT-18|In the college admission process. 
SAT-19|The sffa accused the universities of discriminating against applicants based on race. 
SAT-20|In violation of federal law. 
SAT-21|Or the us constitution. 
SAT-22|It claimed harvard has discriminated against asian-americans. 
SAT-23|With higher test scores. 
SAT-24|And chosen to admit black and hispanic students with lower grades. 
SAT-25|But harvard said the school only considers race. 
SAT-26|In a way that earlier supreme court cases have permitted. 
SAT-27|Harvard president lawrence bacow said in a statement that its admission policy. 
SAT-28|Produces a more diverse student body. 
SAT-29|Which strengthens the learning environment. 
SAT-30|For all. 
SAT-31|The university also noted that its share of asian americans has grown in recent years. 
SAT-32|Harbor reports that nearly 26% of the latest. 
SAT-33|First-year students are asian-american. 
SAT-34|Black students make up 16% and. 
SAT-35|Hispanic students are 12.5% of the class. 
SAT-36|To a lower courts agreed with harvard's arguments and ruled. 
SAT-37|That while its admission policy is not perfect. 
SAT-38|It is constitutional. 
SAT-39|The decisions were based on 40 years of supreme court rulings related to affirmative action. 
SAT-40|The supreme court first ruled in 1978. 
SAT-41|That race could be considered in college admission. 
SAT-42|But the decision banned the medical school of the university of california at davis. 
SAT-43|From establishing racial quotas. 
SAT-44|In other words. 
SAT-45|Schools cannot set aside a percentage. 
SAT-46|Or number of students for admission. 
SAT-47|Based on race alone. 
SAT-48|The high court again ruled in 2003 that the university of michigan's law school. 
SAT-49|Could consider race in its admission process. 
SAT-50|To create a diverse educational environment. 
SAT-51|In the latest filing edward bloom and the sfa asked the court to overturn its own 2003 ruling. 
SAT-52|In the university of michigan case known as. 
SAT-53|Grutter v bollinger. 
SAT-54|It is the second time that bloom has tried to appeal the court. 
SAT-55|To end the consideration of race in college admission. 
SAT-56|In 2016 bloom and others asked the court to review the admission policy of the university of texas at austin. 
SAT-57|But the court followed its earlier decisions. 
SAT-58|And ruled that the use of race in the university's admissions efforts was constitutional. 
SAT-59|Since 2016 two of the justices who voted to support the use of affirmative action. 
SAT-60|In college admission are no longer on the court. 
SAT-61|The addition of three new justices. 
SAT-62|Neil gorsuch. 
SAT-63|Brett kavanaugh and amy coney barrett. 
SAT-64|Has greatly expanded the court's conservative majority. 
SAT-65|And the upcoming retirement of justice stephen breyer. 
SAT-66|It's not expected to change its makeup. 
SAT-67|The administration of former president donald trump had backed blooms case against harvard. 
SAT-68|It also filed legal action. 
SAT-69|Alleging discrimination against asian-american and white people at yale university. 
SAT-70|But the administration of president joe biden recently dropped the case against yale. 
SAT-71|It also urged the supreme court. 
SAT-72|To stay away from the case against harvard. 
SAT-73|And unc. 
SAT-74|And asked the court not to take the extraordinary step of overruling. 
SAT-75|The 2003 decision. 
SAT-76|The supreme court will review the harvard and unc cases later this year. 
SAT-77|And issue a ruling sometime in 2023. 
SAT-78|A striking out of affirmative action will certainly be devastating. 
SAT-79|2 blackout. 
SAT-80|He will be very very. 
SAT-81|Harmful. 
SAT-82|Salida next africa. 
SAT-83|That is kevin brown a professor at the moore school of law at indiana university. 
SAT-84|Brown said affirmative action enabled black students like him. 
SAT-85|To go to law school at yale in the early 1980s. 
SAT-86|It helped white students to learn new ideas. 
SAT-87|From black students in discussion groups. 
SAT-88|Some of these law students who got to know black students for the first time are now lawyers professors and judges he said. 
SAT-89|What you're awesome taking away from the white suit. 
SAT-90|Is this multicultural backgrounds. 
SAT-91|Which means when they become the decision-makers of our society. 
SAT-92|They are most likely to make some very bad decisions. 
SAT-93|Because they don't have enough experience dealing with. 
SAT-94|The different races and ethnicities and cultures that exist in the us. 
SAT-95|I'm dan friedel.

School_Curriculums-1|A big debate in american schools. 
School_Curriculums-2|Is over how much control parents should have in their child's education. 
School_Curriculums-3|Parents around the nation. 
School_Curriculums-4|Have been protesting how certain topics. 
School_Curriculums-5|Such as race history and religion. 
School_Curriculums-6|Are taught in schools. 
School_Curriculums-7|Some have gone to school board meetings and demanded their politicians. 
School_Curriculums-8|Take steps to control what is taught in the classroom. 
School_Curriculums-9|A school board is a group of elected officials who control educational policy and finances. 
School_Curriculums-10|At least 12 republican-led states have recently introduced bills. 
School_Curriculums-11|That require school districts to post their teaching materials online. 
School_Curriculums-12|Some of the bills permit parents to bring legal action. 
School_Curriculums-13|Against schools that do not follow the rules. 
School_Curriculums-14|These are called transparency bills. 
School_Curriculums-15|And in the united states congress republicans have introduced a parents bill of rights. 
School_Curriculums-16|Included in the proposal is a list of rights parents should have. 
School_Curriculums-17|When it comes to their child's schooling. 
School_Curriculums-18|For example. 
School_Curriculums-19|Parents should have the right to know what their children are being taught. 
School_Curriculums-20|It have the right to see the school budget and spending. 
School_Curriculums-21|Republicans that supports the proposal said in a statement. 
School_Curriculums-22|The democrats wants to take power away from parents. 
School_Curriculums-23|It had over more control to politicians and teachers union. 
School_Curriculums-24|To dictate what our children should be taught in classrooms. 
School_Curriculums-25|The bill of rights has gained popularity among conservatives. 
School_Curriculums-26|In response to things like critical race theory. 
School_Curriculums-27|And masks and vaccine mandates in schools. 
School_Curriculums-28|Critical race theory. 
School_Curriculums-29|Is based on the idea that systemic racism. 
School_Curriculums-30|Has deeply shaped american society. 
School_Curriculums-31|Laws and policies. 
School_Curriculums-32|The bill was first introduced in november and is unlikely to pass the democratic-controlled congress. 
School_Curriculums-33|But it may have caused some republican states. 
School_Curriculums-34|To introduce similar measures. 
School_Curriculums-35|Georgia's state senate last week. 
School_Curriculums-36|Approved a measure that protects parental rights in public education. 
School_Curriculums-37|The measure says parents have the right to examine all classroom materials. 
School_Curriculums-38|The rights to see all records relating to their child. 
School_Curriculums-39|The rights to remove their child from sex education. 
School_Curriculums-40|And the right to prevent the creation of photos videos. 
School_Curriculums-41|And voice recordings of their children. 
School_Curriculums-42|Except for security purposes. 
School_Curriculums-43|Many of the rights already exist. 
School_Curriculums-44|A december survey by education week. 
School_Curriculums-45|Found that most teachers say parents should have a say in the curriculum. 
School_Curriculums-46|Or the subjects and materials that are being taught. 
School_Curriculums-47|But just 33% of teachers surveyed. 
School_Curriculums-48|Said parents were involved in selecting curriculum and materials. 
School_Curriculums-49|In their district. 
School_Curriculums-50|The survey also suggested. 
School_Curriculums-51|That parents and teachers. 
School_Curriculums-52|May have differing opinions on what topics. 
School_Curriculums-53|Should be taught. 
School_Curriculums-54|For example. 
School_Curriculums-55|Just 51% of teachers. 
School_Curriculums-56|They believe parents want them to teach about race. 
School_Curriculums-57|But 80% of teachers. 
School_Curriculums-58|Said they should teach about race and racism. 
School_Curriculums-59|In virginia republican glen younkin made parents rights a big part of his campaign for governor. 
School_Curriculums-60|An election he won. 
School_Curriculums-61|He has said that parents should be in charge of their kids education. 
School_Curriculums-62|But teachers and educators. 
School_Curriculums-63|Say transparency bills are unnecessary. 
School_Curriculums-64|Because information on curriculum and spending is already publicly available. 
School_Curriculums-65|Opponents of the bills say it would make teachers jobs. 
School_Curriculums-66|Even more difficult. 
School_Curriculums-67|In a washington post column. 
School_Curriculums-68|Authors jack schneider and jennifer berkshire. 
School_Curriculums-69|Argued that parents have no legal right to determine their child's curriculum. 
School_Curriculums-70|United states law supports the idea. 
School_Curriculums-71|That education should prepare young people to think for themselves. 
School_Curriculums-72|Even if that runs counter to the wishes of parents they said. 
School_Curriculums-73|Robert estes is a middle school science and critical thinking teacher in ohio. 
School_Curriculums-74|One of the states that introduced a transparency bill. 
School_Curriculums-75|He said the bill is a way to control what is taught in the classroom. 
School_Curriculums-76|He told the associated press. 
School_Curriculums-77|The bill is a way to get into the classroom. 
School_Curriculums-78|To pick through what they see and point us in different directions. 
School_Curriculums-79|Or stop us from doing things. 
School_Curriculums-80|I'm doing yoga. 
Schools-1|Millions of students in the united states. 
Schools-2|Go to schools with police officers present. 
Schools-3|The officers are known as school resource officers. 
Schools-4|Or sros. 
Schools-5|They are meant to keep schools and students safe. 
Schools-6|Police in schools dates back to the late 1940s. 
Schools-7|What school shootings including the 1999 shooting at columbine high school. 
Schools-8|And the sandy hook elementary school shooting in 2012. 
Schools-9|Led to more policing of students. 
Schools-10|Between 2006 and 2018. 
Schools-11|The number of schools with at least one sro increased from 42%. 
Schools-12|To 61%. 
Schools-13|Says the organization the center for public integrity. 
Schools-14|But with more officers students have become more likely to have interactions with law enforcement. 
Schools-15|Which could result in arrests. 
Schools-16|And possible criminal charges. 
Schools-17|Federal funding is available for schools that want to hire police. 
Schools-18|But following the 2020 murder of george floyd by a police officer in minneapolis minnesota. 
Schools-19|Cities and states started to rethink their ideas of policing. 
Schools-20|And policing in schools. 
Schools-21|Many school districts around the country either defunded or totally removed sro programs. 
Schools-22|Los angeles the nation's second-largest school district. 
Schools-23|Cut its sro budgets by 1/3. 
Schools-24|Chicago the third-largest. 
Schools-25|Cottage by more than half. 
Schools-26|Other districts fully ended their agreements with police departments. 
Schools-27|But now some districts that removed officers are considering bringing them back. 
Schools-28|Montgomery county maryland largely removed funding for sros in 2020. 
Schools-29|But this year district officials. 
Schools-30|Said there was an increase in serious incidents of crime. 
Schools-31|Including fights and robberies in schools. 
Schools-32|In january. 
Schools-33|A shooting took place at one of the county's high schools. 
Schools-34|In april the county voted to bring police officers back to schools. 
Schools-35|The county says the officers will go through more training. 
Schools-36|Then they did before the sro funding was cut. 
Schools-37|Opponents of sro programs argue that law enforcement. 
Schools-38|Is not the answer to safety incidents at schools. 
Schools-39|That are linked to mental health problems. 
Schools-40|They argue that schools should instead put their funding towards more mental health resources. 
Schools-41|For students. 
Schools-42|Like hiring more social workers and mental health experts. 
Schools-43|Studies have also shown that non-white students are much more likely to be referred to police. 
Schools-44|Dan white students. 
Schools-45|An investigation by the center for public integrity. 
Schools-46|Found that black students are two times more likely to be referred to the police. 
Schools-47|Ben white students. 
Schools-48|Students with disabilities are also two times more likely to be referred to law enforcement. 
Schools-49|All referrals or citations become arrest with criminal charges. 
Schools-50|What's a citation meaning a student must appear before a judge or other law enforcement officials. 
Schools-51|The effects of interactions with police can be serious. 
Schools-52|A 2020 study from tulane university. 
Schools-53|Found that black students who experienced contact with the police by eighth grade. 
Schools-54|Have 11 times greater odds of being arrested when they are 20 years old. 
Schools-55|Ben white students. 
Schools-56|Research has also shown that officer is present in school increases the likelihood children will interact with police. 
Schools-57|University of florida study. 
Schools-58|Found that students behavior that would have otherwise occurred and been handled by school personnel. 
Schools-59|Is more likely to come to the attention of law enforcement. 
Schools-60|In montgomery county. 
Schools-61|Black students made up half of all arrests in schools in 2020. 
Schools-62|But they make up trust one-fifth of the student population. 
Schools-63|Amir whitaker is with the american civil liberties union of southern california. 
Schools-64|He told the los angeles times last year.

Scientists_Discover-1|Scientists who study stars have detected a previously unknown kind of event. 
Scientists_Discover-2|Call don micronova. 
Scientists_Discover-3|The event involves thermonuclear explosions that take place on a star called a white dwarf. 
Scientists_Discover-4|The explosions happened because the white dwarfs gravity has pulled material. 
Scientists_Discover-5|From a companion star. 
Scientists_Discover-6|Astronomers said recently that micronova is by far the least powerful kind of star explosion now known. 
Scientists_Discover-7|Micro novi are observed from earth as bursts of light lasting about 10 hours. 
Scientists_Discover-8|They have been documented on three white dwarf stars. 
Scientists_Discover-9|1 1680 light-years away from earth. 
Scientists_Discover-10|1 3720 light-years away. 
Scientists_Discover-11|And 14 1990 hers away. 
Scientists_Discover-12|A light year is the distance light travels in one year. 
Scientists_Discover-13|Simone scaringi of durham university in england was the lead writer of the study that appeared in the publication nature. 
Scientists_Discover-14|The discovery was an unexpected surprise. 
Scientists_Discover-15|Scaringi said. 
Scientists_Discover-16|He added that finding these events requires looking at the right place at the right time. 
Scientists_Discover-17|White dwarf stars are among the densest objects in the universe. 
Scientists_Discover-18|They result from the collapse of a dying stars core. 
Scientists_Discover-19|They have the mass of our son but are about the size of earth. 
Scientists_Discover-20|Most stars. 
Scientists_Discover-21|Including the sun. 
Scientists_Discover-22|Will end their existence in this way. 
Scientists_Discover-23|Some white dwarfs are part of what is called a binary system. 
Scientists_Discover-24|Meaning that they are in an orbit with another star. 
Scientists_Discover-25|Micro novaya happen in special binary systems with a white dwarf star possessing a strong magnetic field and a low-mass normal star. 
Scientists_Discover-26|The white dwarfs gravity can pull hydrogen gas from the companion stars surface. 
Scientists_Discover-27|The hydrogen then flows toward the white dwarfs magnetic poles. 
Scientists_Discover-28|At the white dwarfs polls. 
Scientists_Discover-29|The pressure and temperature rise. 
Scientists_Discover-30|This causes thermonuclear fusion that converts hydrogen into helium and releases energy. 
Scientists_Discover-31|This fusion is explosive. 
Scientists_Discover-32|And some micronova occurs. 
Scientists_Discover-33|A thermonuclear bomb goes off. 
Scientists_Discover-34|Said astronomer paul group. 
Scientists_Discover-35|Who helped write the study. 
Scientists_Discover-36|The explosion is not widespread and does not destroy the white dwarf. 
Scientists_Discover-37|In fact. 
Scientists_Discover-38|Micronova events can repeat many times. 
Scientists_Discover-39|Only a very small percentage of the white dwarf participates in this explosion. 
Scientists_Discover-40|Roughly about one-millionth of the surface area. 
Scientists_Discover-41|This would be an area of about. 
Scientists_Discover-42|The city of london. 
Scientists_Discover-43|Fruit added. 
Scientists_Discover-44|Each micronova event burns through material equal to one large asteroid. 
Scientists_Discover-45|Or just over one millionth of earth's mass. 
Scientists_Discover-46|Kurinji said. 
Scientists_Discover-47|A micronova is similar to a nova. 
Scientists_Discover-48|A thermonuclear explosion involving a whole star. 
Scientists_Discover-49|With novi. 
Scientists_Discover-50|The white dwarf does not have a strong magnetic field. 
Scientists_Discover-51|Meaning that hydrogen stolen from the companion star is spread rather than staying at the polls. 
Scientists_Discover-52|Nobody can last for weeks or months. 
Scientists_Discover-53|Burning through about a million times more mass than micro novi. 
Scientists_Discover-54|Scaringi said. 
Scientists_Discover-55|The researchers discovered the micro novi when examining data from nasa's tess space telescope. 
Scientists_Discover-56|They used the european southern observatory's very large telescope in chile. 
Scientists_Discover-57|To confirm the explosions involving like dorf's. 
Scientists_Discover-58|There are other kinds of star explosions as well. 
Scientists_Discover-59|Kilonova takes place when two neutron stars. 
Scientists_Discover-60|Or a neutron star and a black hole merge. 
Scientists_Discover-61|A hypernova is a kind of supernova. 
Scientists_Discover-62|Involving a large star exploding at the end of its life. 
Scientists_Discover-63|And collapsing to form a black hole. 
Scientists_Discover-64|And a luminous red nova. 
Scientists_Discover-65|Involves two stars merging.

Scientists_Raise-1|Covid-19 vaccines are saving lives. 
Scientists_Raise-2|But they cannot stop new versions of coronavirus from appearing. 
Scientists_Raise-3|This has led scientists to ask the following questions. 
Scientists_Raise-4|Are more shots needed. 
Scientists_Raise-5|Should changes be made to existing shots. 
Scientists_Raise-6|Or should new vaccines be developed. 
Scientists_Raise-7|Dr. daniel kiritsis is infectious disease chief. 
Scientists_Raise-8|At brigham and women's hospital. 
Scientists_Raise-9|He told the associated press. 
Scientists_Raise-10|We need collectively to be rethinking what does the goal of vaccination. 
Scientists_Raise-11|Kuritzkes said. 
Scientists_Raise-12|It's unrealistic to believe that any kind of vaccination is going to protect people from infection. 
Scientists_Raise-13|From mild symptomatic disease. 
Scientists_Raise-14|Forever. 
Scientists_Raise-15|If the goal is preventing serious illness he added. 
Scientists_Raise-16|We may not need to be doing as much fine-tuning of the vaccines every time a new variant comes. 
Scientists_Raise-17|As the virus changes or mutates. 
Scientists_Raise-18|There is no way to know how bad the next variant will be. 
Scientists_Raise-19|Already a substrate of omicron with its mutations is spreading. 
Scientists_Raise-20|Jennifer nozoe of the johns hopkins center for health security. 
Scientists_Raise-21|Suggested the immediate solution is getting today shots into more arms. 
Scientists_Raise-22|Vista. 
Scientists_Raise-23|She said. 
Scientists_Raise-24|Will reduce the opportunities for the virus to mutate. 
Scientists_Raise-25|The job of blocking infection falls to antibodies. 
Scientists_Raise-26|Which form after either vaccination or getting covid-19. 
Scientists_Raise-27|The antibodies are ready to fight back the next time a person is exposed. 
Scientists_Raise-28|But there is a problem. 
Scientists_Raise-29|Mutations change the appearance of the spike protein that covers the coronavirus. 
Scientists_Raise-30|That is why omicron was able to break through that first defense. 
Scientists_Raise-31|Also the immune system is not designed to always be on high alert. 
Scientists_Raise-32|So the antibodies that fight off infection decrease over time. 
Scientists_Raise-33|Thankfully of heart of the immune system called t-cells helps prevent an infection from turning into severe illness. 
Scientists_Raise-34|The protection t-cells offer last longer because t cells recognize other parts of the virus. 
Scientists_Raise-35|That do not mutate as easily. 
Scientists_Raise-36|In some countries people are getting a third shot. 
Scientists_Raise-37|And in some cases a fourth shot. 
Scientists_Raise-38|To fight against decreased immunity and new variants. 
Scientists_Raise-39|These shots are sometimes called boosters. 
Scientists_Raise-40|The booster further strengthened protection against serious illness. 
Scientists_Raise-41|But research has shown that protection against symptomatic disease from omicron is only about 70%. 
Scientists_Raise-42|Not as high as 94% against earlier variance. 
Scientists_Raise-43|Dr. paul offit is a vaccine expert. 
Scientists_Raise-44|At the children's hospital of philadelphia. 
Scientists_Raise-45|He said that endless boosting just to keep antibody levels high is not the public health strategy that works. 
Scientists_Raise-46|Pfizer biontech and moderna have two of the most effective vaccines against the coronavirus. 
Scientists_Raise-47|The drug companies say they are now testing omicron specific boosters in some american adults. 
Scientists_Raise-48|However it is not clear if health officials would drop vaccines proven to save lives for new ones in hopes of reducing breakthrough infections. 
Scientists_Raise-49|Drugmakers can combine two different kinds of shots. 
Scientists_Raise-50|But they would have to prove that the mixture works well against the virus. 
Scientists_Raise-51|In the united states the national institutes of health. 
Scientists_Raise-52|Is spending about 43 million dollars. 
Scientists_Raise-53|To develop. 
Scientists_Raise-54|So-called pan coronavirus vaccines. 
Scientists_Raise-55|The hope is to have one vaccine that can protect against more than one kind of coronavirus. 
Scientists_Raise-56|Pan means all. 
Scientists_Raise-57|One idea is to have the shots end spike proteins. 
Scientists_Raise-58|From four to eight different versions of the virus. 
Scientists_Raise-59|Rather than one as in today's vaccines. 
Scientists_Raise-60|But nih infectious diseases chief dr. anthony fauci said it will take some time to develop such a vaccine. 
Scientists_Raise-61|Another idea is to create covid-19 vaccine that can be squirted into the nose. 
Scientists_Raise-62|The nasal vaccine can form antibodies ready to fight the virus right where it enters the body. 
Scientists_Raise-63|This kind of vaccine is harder to develop then injected vaccines. 
Scientists_Raise-64|But several companies including india's bharat biotech have started research. 
Scientists_Raise-65|The difficulty with any possible change to the vaccination strategy. 
Scientists_Raise-66|Is that only 10% of people in some countries have received at least one shot of vaccines. 
Scientists_Raise-67|Additionally some approved vaccines do not provide as much protection against omicron as those from pfizer and monday or not. 
Scientists_Raise-68|For example. 
Scientists_Raise-69|Yale university researchers found no omicron targeted antibodies in the blood of people given two shots of china's sinovic. 
Scientists_Raise-70|It means that any change in vaccination strategy must be dealt with locally.

Scientists_Raise_Florida-1|Scientists have successfully bred a threatened species of coral. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-2|Coral rescue organization announced recently. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-3|The breeding was part of a project. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-4|That hopes to restore damaged reefs off the coast of florida. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-5|Coral reefs in florida and the caribbean sea are being affected by stoney coral tissue loss disease. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-6|The disease causes coral to lose its color and die after a. of time. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-7|The florida coral rescue center. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-8|Isn't part. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-9|Funded by the disney conservation fund. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-10|And fish and wildlife foundation of florida. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-11|It has bred hundreds of new roof. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-12|Cactus coral. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-13|In recent weeks. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-14|The breeding center holds a total of 18 florida coral species that are threatened. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-15|Justin zimmerman of the florida coral rescue centre said there is a possibility. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-16|That you could return some of these corals to the wild. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-17|He added there is a possibility of saving the species by doing that. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-18|Stony coral tissue loss disease was first observed near miami. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-19|In 2014. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-20|By 2017 it had spread to florida's northernmost wreath. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-21|And later passed key west to the south. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-22|Coral infected with it die off at a rate of 66 to 100%. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-23|That is deadlier for coral reefs coral bleaching. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-24|A better-known event that is usually caused by a higher water temperatures. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-25|Stony coral tissue loss disease represents another threat to the world's coral reefs. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-26|They already faced serious threats from climate change. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-27|The global coral reef monitoring network. 
Scientists_Raise_Florida-28|Or chi crnn is supported by the united nations and gathers information on coral reefs.

Scientists_Record-1|Scientists say they have identified. 
Scientists_Record-2|The two largest marsquakes. 
Scientists_Record-3|Ever recorded. 
Scientists_Record-4|On the red planet. 
Scientists_Record-5|Amar's quake is a seismic event that happens on mars. 
Scientists_Record-6|It is similar to earthquakes that happened on our planet. 
Scientists_Record-7|The activity was recorded by a device called a seismometer. 
Scientists_Record-8|It is attached to the insight lander. 
Scientists_Record-9|A spacecraft operated. 
Scientists_Record-10|By the american space agency nasa. 
Scientists_Record-11|The seismometer her was designed to be extremely sensitive. 
Scientists_Record-12|For the martian environment. 
Scientists_Record-13|It aims to differentiate between seismic signals coming from inside mars. 
Scientists_Record-14|And activity coming from above the surface. 
Scientists_Record-15|Such as wind. 
Scientists_Record-16|Or meteorite movements. 
Scientists_Record-17|One of the mars quakes happened on august 25th 2021. 
Scientists_Record-18|It had a magnitude of 4.2. 
Scientists_Record-19|The other on september 18th 2021. 
Scientists_Record-20|Measured 4.1. 
Scientists_Record-21|An international team led by researchers from britain's university of bristol. 
Scientists_Record-22|Confirmed the seismic activity. 
Scientists_Record-23|The findings were recently reported in a study in the publication the seismic record. 
Scientists_Record-24|A marsquake happens when soil on mars is subjected to a buildup of pressure so great. 
Scientists_Record-25|That it leads rock structures to break. 
Scientists_Record-26|Explains eth surek. 
Scientists_Record-27|Etah suric is a public research university. 
Scientists_Record-28|Insurox switzerland. 
Scientists_Record-29|Researchers from the university took part in the latest study. 
Scientists_Record-30|The insight lander brought the first seismometer to mars in late 2018. 
Scientists_Record-31|It recorded its first mars quake in april 2019. 
Scientists_Record-32|Since then it has recorded hundreds of mars quakes. 
Scientists_Record-33|But examinations of the two reported in the study. 
Scientists_Record-34|Suggest they were the largest yet to hit mars. 
Scientists_Record-35|The researchers said the to mars quakes. 
Scientists_Record-36|We're five times stronger than any others recorded before. 
Scientists_Record-37|They were also the first seismic events to happen on the planet's pharcyde from where the insight lander sits. 
Scientists_Record-38|The study notes that as of october 2021 records from inside included nearly 1,000 seismic events. 
Scientists_Record-39|All of those happened on the side of mars where the spacecraft operates. 
Scientists_Record-40|In an area called. 
Scientists_Record-41|Elysium planitia. 
Scientists_Record-42|Nasa says that area sits just north of mars equator. 
Scientists_Record-43|And is the second largest volcanic area. 
Scientists_Record-44|On the planet. 
Scientists_Record-45|As the seismic activity was still being studied nasa noted in a statement last september that it appeared the 4.2 mars quake happened about 8,500 km from the insight lander. 
Scientists_Record-46|Both large marsquakes happened in an area known as the core shadow zone. 
Scientists_Record-47|Said a statement by the seismological society of america. 
Scientists_Record-48|That is a part of mars where some kinds of seismic waves cannot travel directly to insights seismometer. 
Scientists_Record-49|This is because the waves get blocked. 
Scientists_Record-50|Or otherwise affected by the planets core. 
Scientists_Record-51|The waves instead yet reflected at least once at the surface before traveling to the seismometer. 
Scientists_Record-52|The society statement said. 
Scientists_Record-53|Recording events within the core shadow zone is a real stepping stone for our understanding of mars. 
Scientists_Record-54|Said service salon. 
Scientists_Record-55|A researcher with eth surek. 
Scientists_Record-56|Who helped lead the study. 
Scientists_Record-57|He added that the energy that travels within the core shadow of mars. 
Scientists_Record-58|Has never been seismological e studied before. 
Scientists_Record-59|The researchers say such seismic wave data. 
Scientists_Record-60|Can help them learn more about deeper layers within mars. 
Scientists_Record-61|As well as the planets current seismic activity. 
Scientists_Record-62|I'm bryan lanning. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-1|On thursday. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-2|Scientists released the first image of the very large black hole at the center of our milky way galaxy. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-3|The mysterious object. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-4|Called sagittarius a star. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-5|Or sadder a star. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-6|Is only the second black hole to be imaged. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-7|The university of arizona's fariello cell called the black hole the gentle giant in the center of our galaxy while announcing the new image. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-8|The international group behind the event horizon telescope. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-9|Tht project released the image. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-10|Phd in 2019 revealed the first ever photo of a black hole. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-11|That is at the heart of a different galaxy. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-12|Sagittarius a star has four million times the mass of our sun. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-13|And is located about 26,000 light-years from earth. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-14|I like here is the distance light travels in a year. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-15|About 9.5 trillion km. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-16|Black holes are extremely dense. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-17|Their gravitational pull is so powerful that nothing. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-18|Not even the light. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-19|Can escape. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-20|As a result. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-21|It is difficult to see them. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-22|Project scientists looked for a ring of light around an area of darkness representing the black hole. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-23|This is known as the black holes shadow or silhouette. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-24|The image released in 2019 of the supermassive black hole in our galaxy called messier 87. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-25|Or m87. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-26|Showed a ring of red. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-27|Yellow and white. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-28|Surrounding a dark center. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-29|The m87 black hole is far more distant and large than sagittarius a star. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-30|The researchers said that sagittarius a star. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-31|Despite being much closer to our solar system than m87. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-32|What's harder to image. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-33|Linda blackburn and eht data scientist at the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-34|Fed. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-35|Sagittarius a-star is over a thousand times less massive than the black hole at med7. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-36|But since it is in our own galaxy it is much closer and should appear just slightly larger on this guy. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-37|The event horizon telescope is a global group of observatories. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-38|Working to study radio sources linked to black holes. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-39|The project began in 2012. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-40|To try to directly observe the immediate environment. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-41|About black hole. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-42|There are different kinds of black holes. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-43|The smallest are called stellar-mass black holes. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-44|Intermediate-mass black holes have more mass. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-45|And finally there are the supermassive black holes. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-46|That are at the center of most galaxies. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-47|These are thought to appear relatively soon after their galaxies are formed. 
Scientists_Release_Picture-48|Thursday's announcement was made in simultaneous news conferences in the united states.

Scientists_Report-1|Australian scientists say 91% of coral studied in the great barrier reef this year suffered bleaching damage. 
Scientists_Report-2|Coral gets bleached when ocean temperatures reach unusually warm levels. 
Scientists_Report-3|The damage to the great barrier reef represents the fourth mass bleaching event to happen in the past 7 years. 
Scientists_Report-4|The scientists said. 
Scientists_Report-5|Bleaching in 2016. 
Scientists_Report-6|2017 and 2020 was blamed for damaging two-thirds of the great barrier reef coral. 
Scientists_Report-7|The great barrier reef covers about 344,000 square kilometers of area off of australia's northeast coast. 
Scientists_Report-8|It contains about 3,000 reefs. 
Scientists_Report-9|Natural structures made by different kinds of coral. 
Scientists_Report-10|The reve also includes more than 900 islands. 
Scientists_Report-11|The latest bleaching event is described in a yearly report recently released by the australian governments great barrier reef marine authority. 
Scientists_Report-12|Coral bleaching can be caused by the effects of climate change but the scientists said the most recent event. 
Scientists_Report-13|Was the reefs first bleaching to happen during a la nina weather.. 
Scientists_Report-14|Aulani event happens when ocean surface waters cool along the pacific coast of the south american tropics. 
Scientists_Report-15|This takes place every two to seven years. 
Scientists_Report-16|Coral suffers bleaching as a reaction to heat stress. 
Scientists_Report-17|But scientists hope that most of the coral will recover from the current event said david wachenfeld. 
Scientists_Report-18|He is the chief scientist at the country's marine authority which oversees the reefs ecosystem. 
Scientists_Report-19|Wachenfeld told the associated press that early signs so far suggest the mortality won't be very high. 
Scientists_Report-20|He compared the latest event to the one that happened in 2020. 
Scientists_Report-21|That event produced mass bleaching but there was low mortality meaning the coral largely did not die. 
Scientists_Report-22|The bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 lead to quite high levels of coral mortality wachenfeld said. 
Scientists_Report-23|Simon bradshaw is a researcher at australia's climate council environmental group. 
Scientists_Report-24|He told the ap the latest report demonstrates that the reefs survival depends on deep cuts in worldwide carbon emissions over the next 10 years. 
Scientists_Report-25|This is heartbreaking this is deeply troubling. 
Scientists_Report-26|Bradshaw said. 
Scientists_Report-27|It shows that our barrier reef really is in very serious trouble.

Sea_Life_Stars-2|An underwater camera captures video from another world. 
Sea_Life_Stars-3|That camera is showing marine life in an unusual way. 
Sea_Life_Stars-4|The camera is in miami's government cut waterway for shipping. 
Sea_Life_Stars-5|And it belongs to coral morphologic. 
Sea_Life_Stars-6|It is a business led by a scientist and the musician.

Sea_Life_Stars-12|And it sells clothing for the beach with ocean designs. 
Sea_Life_Stars-13|Colin ford and his business partner j.d. mckay recently discussed their business with the associated press. 
Sea_Life_Stars-14|We aren't all art. 
Sea_Life_Stars-15|We aren't all science. 
Sea_Life_Stars-16|We aren't all tech. 
Sea_Life_Stars-17|We are in alchemy. 
Sea_Life_Stars-18|Port said. 
Sea_Life_Stars-19|Alchemy is a term that means a process that changes or transform something into something else even more valuable. 
Sea_Life_Stars-20|One of their most popular projects is the coral city camera. 
Sea_Life_Stars-21|It recently passed two million views and usually has about 100 fewer has online at any given time each day. 
Sea_Life_Stars-22|Ford said. 
Sea_Life_Stars-23|We're going to actually be able to document one year of coral growth. 
Sea_Life_Stars-24|He said that has never been done in a live environment on a coral reef. 
Sea_Life_Stars-25|Ford added that is only possible because we have this technological connection right here at the port of miami that allows us to have power and internet. 
Sea_Life_Stars-26|The live stream has already revealed that staghorn and other corals can do well in an undersea environment. 
Sea_Life_Stars-27|Close to a large city. 
Sea_Life_Stars-28|Toward and mckay's video has shown the fluorescence in some of the coral. 
Sea_Life_Stars-29|That is an unexpected behavior for such corals. 
Sea_Life_Stars-30|Ford said. 
Sea_Life_Stars-31|Ford added that the video has shown 177 species of fish and other sea life including dolphins and manatees. 
Sea_Life_Stars-32|Meanwhile. 
Sea_Life_Stars-33|Described how he mixes video and music in another project. 
Sea_Life_Stars-34|He uses an aquarium a very large container for sea creatures. 
Sea_Life_Stars-35|Mckay explained. 
Sea_Life_Stars-36|We essentially create a set with one of these aquariums and then obviously there's actors coral or shrimp or whatever. 
Sea_Life_Stars-37|And then we film it. 
Sea_Life_Stars-38|I soundtrack it with some ambience like sounds something very oceanic. 
Sea_Life_Stars-39|Ambient music is quiet and relaxing with sounds that repeat many times. 
Sea_Life_Stars-40|4 describe the importance of their work to the environment. 
Sea_Life_Stars-41|The forest is a priceless place for coral research. 
Sea_Life_Stars-42|He said. 
Sea_Life_Stars-43|Beyond the science. 
Sea_Life_Stars-44|There are the clothes. 
Sea_Life_Stars-45|Coral morphologic sells swimwear that takes designs from flower anemones in brain coral. 
Sea_Life_Stars-46|The company says its uses materials that are good for the environment. 
Sea_Life_Stars-47|Such as a kind of nylon taken from old fishing nets. 
Sea_Life_Stars-48|We see the power of tech connecting people with nature. 
Sea_Life_Stars-49|We are lucky as artists. 
Sea_Life_Stars-50|And corals are benefiting. 
Sea_Life_Stars-51|Forts at.

Seniors_Free-1|From voa learning english. 
Seniors_Free-2|This is the health and lifestyle report. 
Seniors_Free-3|For many blind people and those with vision difficulties. 
Seniors_Free-4|Life can be made easier with. 
Seniors_Free-5|A guide dog. 
Seniors_Free-6|But making a good guide dog takes much work. 
Seniors_Free-7|And for many the long road begins when the dog is a puppy. 
Seniors_Free-8|Take for example the 58 week old puppies that arrived at the tipton airport. 
Seniors_Free-9|In fort meade maryland. 
Seniors_Free-10|Early in february. 
Seniors_Free-11|About time they were loving playful animals. 
Seniors_Free-12|Like all puppies. 
Seniors_Free-13|Now however the labrador retriever and german shepherd puppies are on the road to becoming useful members of society. 
Seniors_Free-14|If they prove themselves able they could become guide dogs. 
Seniors_Free-15|They will help to improve the lives of people with vision loss and vision impairment. 
Seniors_Free-16|The faithful friends to be are part of a training program. 
Seniors_Free-17|Of an organization called. 
Seniors_Free-18|Guiding eyes for the blind. 
Seniors_Free-19|The puppies flew from the organization's head office in yorktown heights new york. 
Seniors_Free-20|To maryland. 
Seniors_Free-21|Onboard. 
Seniors_Free-22|A pilot's to the rescue flight. 
Seniors_Free-23|Pilots to the rescue is a not-for-profit organization. 
Seniors_Free-24|That transport animals as well as people at risk. 
Seniors_Free-25|It states on its website. 
Seniors_Free-26|The puppies were born in yorktown heights. 
Seniors_Free-27|And they spent the first two months of their lives with their moms and siblings. 
Seniors_Free-28|The young dogs were bred for health and temperament. 
Seniors_Free-29|Here temperament means how they respond to their environment. 
Seniors_Free-30|However breeding alone will not be enough to turn these puppies into guide dogs. 
Seniors_Free-31|They will need training from dog training experts. 
Seniors_Free-32|They also will need to be nurtured by volunteers called. 
Seniors_Free-33|Puppy raisers. 
Seniors_Free-34|The goal of this nurturing by puppy raisers and their families. 
Seniors_Free-35|Is to turn the energetic playful puppies. 
Seniors_Free-36|Into well-behaved. 
Seniors_Free-37|And well-socialized dogs. 
Seniors_Free-38|These are the qualities needed for a successful guide dog. 
Seniors_Free-39|Well-bred well-trained well-behaved. 
Seniors_Free-40|And well-socialized. 
Seniors_Free-41|The process will take about 14 to 16 months of weekly classes and testing. 
Seniors_Free-42|Training starts with the basics. 
Seniors_Free-43|Name recognition. 
Seniors_Free-44|Behavior. 
Seniors_Free-45|And commands. 
Seniors_Free-46|Such as. 
Seniors_Free-47|And down. 
Seniors_Free-48|The trainers then move on to more complex commands. 
Seniors_Free-49|After that the puppies are given to the puppy raisers. 
Seniors_Free-50|The razors and their families will show the puppies the world. 
Seniors_Free-51|And how to act in it. 
Seniors_Free-52|A manager for guiding eyes for the blind puppy program is cindy tate. 
Seniors_Free-53|She told the associated press that other experts will keep a watchful eye on the training. 
Seniors_Free-54|And help with any problems the razors may have along the way. 
Seniors_Free-55|Once a solid loving foundation is in place. 
Seniors_Free-56|Puppies must leave their razors. 
Seniors_Free-57|And return to the guiding eyes training center. 
Seniors_Free-58|For official guide dog training. 
Seniors_Free-59|Formal training is where the dogs demonstrate. 
Seniors_Free-60|Whether they will become a guide dog for the blind. 
Seniors_Free-61|A different kind of service dog. 
Seniors_Free-62|Or someone's pet. 
Seniors_Free-63|This means there is almost always a tearful goodbye. 
Seniors_Free-64|Denali is one of four bigger puppies. 
Seniors_Free-65|He was placed aboard a return flights to guiding eyes the day the new puppies arrived. 
Seniors_Free-66|Tate's got tears in her eyes as she watched puppy raiser carolyn schaefer say goodbye to the yellow labrador. 
Seniors_Free-67|And walk him to the plane. 
Seniors_Free-68|This is the hard part tate said. 
Seniors_Free-69|But she said a guide dog has the power to help people. 
Seniors_Free-70|And that softens the blow. 
Seniors_Free-71|An expression that means makes a hard thing easier. 
Seniors_Free-72|Even though it can be very hard to leave the puppies. 
Seniors_Free-73|Puppy raisers come back over and over. 
Seniors_Free-74|Chase herself has raised many. 
Seniors_Free-75|She lists them all. 
Seniors_Free-76|Roxanne katrina velour gus mystic organ kelby tad eagle winnie and now kenji. 
Seniors_Free-77|Her 11th future guide dog puppy.

Sharing_Our_Loneliness-4|And the world laughs with you. 
Sharing_Our_Loneliness-5|Cry and you cry alone. 
Sharing_Our_Loneliness-6|It suggests that people do not want to share in the sadness of others. 
Sharing_Our_Loneliness-7|But what if sharing our sadness actually helps us feel better. 
Sharing_Our_Loneliness-8|That was the goal of natalie eve garrett. 
Sharing_Our_Loneliness-9|When she thought of collecting stories about.

Small_space-1|Gardeners or people who grow plants and crops. 
Small_space-2|Typically use a part of land on their property. 
Small_space-3|But for many people. 
Small_space-4|Having a bit of land is just a dream. 
Small_space-5|Some people have limited ability to move around. 
Small_space-6|Others might be scared because they are new to gardening. 
Small_space-7|There is a solution to these barriers. 
Small_space-8|Jessica damian oh is an expert an educator. 
Small_space-9|In all things gardening. 
Small_space-10|She invites people to start with small gardens. 
Small_space-11|Even for people with a lot of land. 
Small_space-12|If they start with small container gardening. 
Small_space-13|They can avoid weeds and just care for a few plants. 
Small_space-14|Many people who produced plants have decreased the size of plants we eat for food. 
Small_space-15|That is because of the gardening renaissance. 
Small_space-16|People are gardening on the tops of their homes. 
Small_space-17|Inspire escapes. 
Small_space-18|Amazon small outdoor areas for sitting. 
Small_space-19|These places are best for planting vegetables in containers. 
Small_space-20|Damiana suggest. 
Small_space-21|Looking for small varieties of your favorite vegetable. 
Small_space-22|Even though they are small. 
Small_space-23|The plant will produce a lot. 
Small_space-24|Crops that have the word little. 
Small_space-25|Mini. 
Small_space-26|And the baby. 
Small_space-27|Bike patio baby eggplants. 
Small_space-28|Sugar baby watermelons. 
Small_space-29|Or kitchen minis tomatoes. 
Small_space-30|Will be perfect for small containers. 
Small_space-31|Plants that grow towards the sky. 
Small_space-32|And most herbs. 
Small_space-33|Also grow well in pots. 
Small_space-34|After you select the type of crop you want to grow. 
Small_space-35|You must consider the container. 
Small_space-36|The type of soil or potting mix. 
Small_space-37|And where your plants will grow. 
Small_space-38|This is an important step. 
Small_space-39|Unlike plants that are grown in the ground. 
Small_space-40|Plants grown in containers need more water and fertilizer. 
Small_space-41|Use deep pots made of metal. 
Small_space-42|Or plastic. 
Small_space-43|To hold in the water. 
Small_space-44|This can decrease the amount you have to water the plants. 
Small_space-45|Be sure the containers have holes in the bottom to drain the water. 
Small_space-46|Dirt from your land is too heavy. 
Small_space-47|And may house disease or insects. 
Small_space-48|Instead. 
Small_space-49|You can choose excellent organic potting mix that does not have soil mixed it. 
Small_space-50|You should also mix in organic fertilizer. 
Small_space-51|That can be used with water if the mixture does not include it. 
Small_space-52|Keep using the fertilizer every week. 
Small_space-53|210 days throughout the time you grow. 
Small_space-54|After planting. 
Small_space-55|Use mulch on top of the potting mix. 
Small_space-56|To decrease evaporation. 
Small_space-57|Keep the soil temperature even. 
Small_space-58|And prevent weeds from growing. 
Small_space-59|Most plants that grow food need at least six hours of sunlight a day. 
Small_space-60|But if you have an area with little sunlight. 
Small_space-61|Try growing a plant that prefers last sun. 
Small_space-62|Like carrots. 
Small_space-63|Greens for beats. 
Small_space-64|Depending on what you're growing. 
Small_space-65|Use different size pot. 
Small_space-66|Small varieties of plants. 
Small_space-67|Do well in anything from 2 gal to 5 gal. 
Small_space-68|Depending on the size of the plant. 
Small_space-69|Cucumbers and peas require 2 gallon containers. 
Small_space-70|Small carrots and peppers need 5 gal pots. 
Small_space-71|Larger plants like watermelons need 8 to 10 gallons. 
Small_space-72|For potatoes you can use a plastic liner. 
Small_space-73|With holes and small rocks in the bottom. 
Small_space-74|For water to drain. 
Small_space-75|Herbs do not need extra fertilizer throughout the growing season. 
Small_space-76|But they do need the smallest size container. 
Small_space-77|No less than a half gallon. 
Small_space-78|The best way to check for water in the soil. 
Small_space-79|Is by pushing your finger about 2in. 
Small_space-80|Into the soil. 
Small_space-81|And if the soil feels dry by the roots of the plant. 
Small_space-82|Add water. 
Small_space-83|Watering the plants less often but more intensely. 
Small_space-84|At one time. 
Small_space-85|Is better than watering a little bit every day. 
Small_space-86|With these ideas a little planning. 
Small_space-87|And a correct plant. 
Small_space-88|Your small space can grow a lot of crops. 
Small_space-89|I'm faith pirlo.

Spinal_Cord_Implant-37|The seedlings will become stronger as a result. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-38|When seedlings first appear remove the covering and put containers by a sunny window. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-39|You can also put them under special lighting devices called grow lamps for 14 hours a day. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-40|Costly lamps are not necessary. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-41|Ordinary lights will work. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-42|Keep the white source no more than 9:55 cm above the plants. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-43|Changing its height as the seedlings grow. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-44|If several seedlings sprout. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-45|In each container. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-46|Cut the weakest at the soil line using small scissors. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-47|The aim is to keep only one strong looking at plant per container section. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-48|If you let more than one ceiling remain the roots may become mixed together. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-49|The young plants might not survive. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-50|A week before the last frost date. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-51|Begin to harden off plants. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-52|By placing them outside for longer periods of time each day. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-53|Place them in a shady area protected from wind. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-54|Leave them there for one hour and then bring them back inside. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-55|Repeat the next day but leave them out for 2 hours. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-56|Continue adding one hour of outdoor time each day for one week. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-57|By the end of the week. 
Spinal_Cord_Implant-58|Your plants will be prepared to survive and grow in your garden outside.

Spreading_Omicron-1|Anomic ron sub variant of the covid-19 virus is spreading fast in many parts of the world. 
Spreading_Omicron-2|And raising concerns. 
Spreading_Omicron-3|For experts. 
Spreading_Omicron-4|This week. 
Spreading_Omicron-5|The centers for disease control and prevention reported that. 
Spreading_Omicron-6|Ba2 assubhu variant of omicron. 
Spreading_Omicron-7|Has caused 35% of all new cases in the united states. 
Spreading_Omicron-8|And the northeastern states including new york. 
Spreading_Omicron-9|New jersey. 
Spreading_Omicron-10|And massachusetts. 
Spreading_Omicron-11|Ba2. 
Spreading_Omicron-12|Has made up more than half of the cases. 
Spreading_Omicron-13|The total number of infections however. 
Spreading_Omicron-14|Has been decreasing. 
Spreading_Omicron-15|And officials around the country. 
Spreading_Omicron-16|Have lifted measures. 
Spreading_Omicron-17|Such as required cloth face coverings. 
Spreading_Omicron-18|And social distancing. 
Spreading_Omicron-19|The omicron variant of the virus was first reported. 
Spreading_Omicron-20|Last november in south africa. 
Spreading_Omicron-21|It has three main sub variant. 
Spreading_Omicron-22|Known as ba1 ba2. 
Spreading_Omicron-23|And ba3. 
Spreading_Omicron-24|Scientist believe. 
Spreading_Omicron-25|They all appeared at the same time. 
Spreading_Omicron-26|But omicron ba1 was linked to most of the cases reported. 
Spreading_Omicron-27|Over recent months. 
Spreading_Omicron-28|Last month. 
Spreading_Omicron-29|The world health organization. 
Spreading_Omicron-30|Who. 
Spreading_Omicron-31|Said. 
Spreading_Omicron-32|Reported cases of omicron ba2 have been increasing in comparison to be a1. 
Spreading_Omicron-33|The health agency found. 
Spreading_Omicron-34|That old oba to could spread faster. 
Spreading_Omicron-35|It does not make people sicker than ba1. 
Spreading_Omicron-36|By tuesday the whona its weekly report. 
Spreading_Omicron-37|That da2 had overtaken all other versions of the virus and southeast asia. 
Spreading_Omicron-38|The eastern mediterranean. 
Spreading_Omicron-39|Africa. 
Spreading_Omicron-40|The western pacific. 
Spreading_Omicron-41|And europe. 
Spreading_Omicron-42|And breton. 
Spreading_Omicron-43|The office for national statistics also reported. 
Spreading_Omicron-44|Bad cases of ba2 infection. 
Spreading_Omicron-45|Head outnumbered other versions by early march. 
Spreading_Omicron-46|Dr. anthony fauci. 
Spreading_Omicron-47|Is the u.s. government stop infectious disease expert. 
Spreading_Omicron-48|He told abc's this week program. 
Spreading_Omicron-49|That the us would likely see an increase of infections like britain. 
Spreading_Omicron-50|Fauci said. 
Spreading_Omicron-51|They have ba2. 
Spreading_Omicron-52|They have a relaxation of some restrictions. 
Spreading_Omicron-53|Such as indoor masking. 
Spreading_Omicron-54|Additionally immunity from vaccines. 
Spreading_Omicron-55|And past infections. 
Spreading_Omicron-56|Was also decreasing. 
Spreading_Omicron-57|Dr. eric topol his head of scripps research translational institute. 
Spreading_Omicron-58|He told the associated press. 
Spreading_Omicron-59|It's inevitable. 
Spreading_Omicron-60|We will see a ba2 wave here. 
Spreading_Omicron-61|However. 
Spreading_Omicron-62|Ali mokdad a professor at the institute for health metrics and evaluation. 
Spreading_Omicron-63|Ihme. 
Spreading_Omicron-64|At the university of washington. 
Spreading_Omicron-65|Does not expect a big increase in the u.s. in the coming weeks. 
Spreading_Omicron-66|He wrote on twitter. 
Spreading_Omicron-67|Our models do not suggest there will be much of an increase in the us. 
Spreading_Omicron-68|In the next week's if at all. 
Spreading_Omicron-69|However it is possible that the rapid return to preco vat19 behavior. 
Spreading_Omicron-70|And the spread of ba to. 
Spreading_Omicron-71|Could see a short. of increasing case numbers. 
Spreading_Omicron-72|And an early study in qatar. 
Spreading_Omicron-73|Also suggest that vaccines from pfizer biontech. 
Spreading_Omicron-74|And moderna. 
Spreading_Omicron-75|Will work. 
Spreading_Omicron-76|Against both omicron sub variants. 
Spreading_Omicron-77|The results suggest that the level of protection against ba2 is about the same as for ba1.

Start_Growing_Seeds-1|Researchers say a new electrical device placed in 3 paralyzed patients. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-2|Has help them walk again. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-3|The lower bodies of the three patients were left paralyzed after they suffered spinal cord injuries. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-4|But a device implanted in the spinal cord was able to send electrical signals to the muscles. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-5|To permit them to stand walk and exercise. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-6|The device is designed to copy an action of the brain. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-7|In which it sends signals to the spinal cord that result in muscle movement. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-8|When the spinal cord receives the brain signals. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-9|It stimulates a collection of nerve cells that can activate different muscles. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-10|In patients with serious spinal cord injuries. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-11|Messages from the brain have difficulty reaching the nerves. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-12|But scientists have discovered that neurons which receive and send signals for muscle movements. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-13|Often still work in injured patients. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-14|Past research into spinal cord injuries has centered on the use of electrical devices to stimulate neurons. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-15|The publication nature reports. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-16|Gregoire corteen and jocelyn block of the swiss federal institute of technology in lausanne lead the latest experiments. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-17|The results were published in a study in nature medicine. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-18|The experiments involved three men who had been injured in motorbike accidents. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-19|The patients ages were 29/32 and 41 years old. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-20|Their injuries were to an area called the thoracic spine. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-21|Which is below the neck and above the lowest part of the back. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-22|The researchers reported that all three patients who got the spinal cord implants were able to take their first steps within an hour after receiving them. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-23|Over the next six months the patient's regained the ability to take part in more advanced walking activities. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-24|The study found. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-25|They were also able to ride bicycles and swim in community settings. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-26|The individuals can control the nerve stimulation devices themselves. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-27|By using a personal electronic device. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-28|The researchers said. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-29|Ricotti from italy is one of the patients. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-30|He told reporters that the first step he took while using the device. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-31|Was a very emotional experience. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-32|Ricotti added that he can now stand for several hours and walk nearly a kilometer. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-33|Other researchers have attempted to help paralyzed patients walk. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-34|By stimulating nerves through the back of the spine. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-35|But the federal institute of technologies corteen told reuters that his team redesigned the devices so signals would enter the spine from the sides. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-36|This method permits more direct targeting and activation of spinal cord areas. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-37|He said. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-38|The team then developed artificial intelligence systems link to the device. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-39|The ai controls electrodes on the device to send signals to stimulate individual nerves that control muscles needed for walking and other activities. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-40|When the device was implanted patients could immediately activate their legs and step. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-41|Said researcher jocelyn block. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-42|However because the patients muscles were weak. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-43|From not being used they needed help with supporting their weight. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-44|The researchers said. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-45|It also took some time for them to learn to work with the technology. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-46|Even though the patients have the ability to perform several kinds of activities. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-47|The team said they did not regain completely natural movements. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-48|Still blocked sad. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-49|The more they train the more they start lifting their muscles. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-50|The more fluid it becomes. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-51|Brocato said he activates the implant daily at home and continues to get stronger. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-52|I see the improvement everyday he said. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-53|Adding. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-54|I feel better when i use it. 
Start_Growing_Seeds-55|I'm brian lynn. 
States_Pass-1|Conservative american states are introducing more bills controlling how history and race is taught in public schools. 
States_Pass-2|They are also giving parents more supervision over local schools and school boards. 
States_Pass-3|A school board. 
States_Pass-4|Is a group of elected officials who supervise a school district's budget and educational decisions. 
States_Pass-5|Hey bill passed in indiana that limits how race history and politics. 
States_Pass-6|Can be taught in the classroom. 
States_Pass-7|It also permits parents. 
States_Pass-8|To bring complaints and legal action. 
States_Pass-9|Against schools. 
States_Pass-10|Americans are divided on how racism and discrimination in the present-day should be taught. 
States_Pass-11|A recent study by the apm research lab. 
States_Pass-12|A policy research center found. 
States_Pass-13|In a survey of 1,200 adults. 
States_Pass-14|49% said schools should teach the ongoing effects of slavery and racism. 
States_Pass-15|In the united states. 
States_Pass-16|41% say schools should teach the history of racism. 
States_Pass-17|But not about race relations today. 
States_Pass-18|Answers were also very divided by race. 
States_Pass-19|While 79% of black people surveyed. 
States_Pass-20|Said the ongoing effects of racism should be taught. 
States_Pass-21|Just 41% of whites felt the same. 
States_Pass-22|Teaching how historical racism and slavery affect life today. 
States_Pass-23|Is a central idea in critical race theory. 
States_Pass-24|Orsi's rt. 
States_Pass-25|Critical race theory is about how racism and white supremacy. 
States_Pass-26|Have shaped american society laws and policies. 
States_Pass-27|It has also come under attack from republican lawmakers. 
States_Pass-28|In january. 
States_Pass-29|Newly-elected virginia governor republican glen younkin. 
States_Pass-30|Signed an executive order banning critical race theory. 
States_Pass-31|Republican states including tennessee and texas. 
States_Pass-32|Passed similar laws last year. 
States_Pass-33|But it is unclear how many schools actually teach crt. 
States_Pass-34|Critics of such laws. 
States_Pass-35|Also say that any attempt to teach racism. 
States_Pass-36|It's labeled as critical race theory. 
States_Pass-37|In a recent interview with the new yorker magazine. 
States_Pass-38|Democratic us representative alexandria ocasio-cortez. 
States_Pass-39|Said the attempt to limit how history is taught. 
States_Pass-40|Is like returning to the infamous jim crow era in the southern us. 
States_Pass-41|Jim crow laws in place for several decades until the 1960s. 
States_Pass-42|Discriminated against black americans in effectively all areas of life. 
States_Pass-43|During that time racism and slavery. 
States_Pass-44|Was almost only talked from the white perspective. 
States_Pass-45|If it was taught at all. 
States_Pass-46|Republican lawmakers like younkin argue that parents and families. 
States_Pass-47|Should have more of a say in what is taught in schools. 
States_Pass-48|Also called the curriculum. 
States_Pass-49|And many states have introduced bills. 
States_Pass-50|That give parents more control over schools. 
States_Pass-51|Epm's study found that 41% of americans. 
States_Pass-52|Think parents should have the most influence. 
States_Pass-53|And how race is taught to children. 
States_Pass-54|Nbc news reports that 12 states have introduced bills. 
States_Pass-55|That requires schools to put their teaching materials online. 
States_Pass-56|It is part of a larger national push by republicans. 
States_Pass-57|For a parents bill of rights. 
States_Pass-58|Head of the midterm congressional elections. 
States_Pass-59|Teachers say parents can already see what their children learn. 
States_Pass-60|They worry that the laws would create unnecessary work. 
States_Pass-61|And could threaten their professional independence. 
States_Pass-62|Educators say they are not against keeping parents informed. 
States_Pass-63|But they see a risk that the new laws will bring censorship. 
States_Pass-64|And more teachers leaving the profession. 
States_Pass-65|States considering some version of the idea include ohio. 
States_Pass-66|Arizona florida-georgia indiana iowa michigan north carolina and west virginia. 
States_Pass-67|Similar laws have been stopped by democratic governors. 
States_Pass-68|In pennsylvania and wisconsin. 
States_Pass-69|Katie peters is a high school teacher in toledo ohio. 
States_Pass-70|She told the associated press. 
States_Pass-71|The bill suggests there's some hiding happening. 
States_Pass-72|She added that the parents who have cared to look. 
States_Pass-73|Have always had access. 
States_Pass-74|Conservative lawmakers. 
States_Pass-75|Have called for a parents bill of rights. 
States_Pass-76|Which gives parents access to classroom materials. 
States_Pass-77|And academic medical and safety records. 
States_Pass-78|It would also permit entry to school buildings & more. 
States_Pass-79|Scotts tomorrow is presidents of ohio's largest teachers union. 
States_Pass-80|He is concerned that such bills will add to the increase in resignations and retirements. 
States_Pass-81|That have occurred. 
States_Pass-82|From teaching during covid-19. 
States_Pass-83|Teachers he said. 
States_Pass-84|Have felt caught up in a culture war.

Stop_Throwing-1|Talk to the best cooks in italy. 
Stop_Throwing-2|And you might learn a simple secret. 
Stop_Throwing-3|To making great pasta. 
Stop_Throwing-4|Save the water the noodles are cooked in. 
Stop_Throwing-5|After pasta noodles have finished cooking. 
Stop_Throwing-6|Italian cooks do not throw out all the water. 
Stop_Throwing-7|They keep a small amount to use when making the sauce for the dish. 
Stop_Throwing-8|The leftover water contains starch from the pasta. 
Stop_Throwing-9|This starch helps other ingredients stick to the noodles. 
Stop_Throwing-10|It also helps to thicken the sauce. 
Stop_Throwing-11|And because the water often has salt. 
Stop_Throwing-12|And sometimes other seasonings. 
Stop_Throwing-13|It adds flavor to. 
Stop_Throwing-14|Food expert christopher kimball. 
Stop_Throwing-15|Recently wrote about the secret of making pasta. 
Stop_Throwing-16|For the associated press. 
Stop_Throwing-17|He said he and his team at milk street. 
Stop_Throwing-18|Thought of this method. 
Stop_Throwing-19|Well developing recipes for a one-pot pasta. 
Stop_Throwing-20|With this one pot recipe. 
Stop_Throwing-21|You not only get a rich and thick sauce. 
Stop_Throwing-22|You also have less cleanup. 
Stop_Throwing-23|The starch released by the pasta gives the sauce thickness. 
Stop_Throwing-24|And the pasta takes in more of the sauces flavors. 
Stop_Throwing-25|Remember these terms. 
Stop_Throwing-26|A recipe is the list of steps needed to make a dish. 
Stop_Throwing-27|And ingredients are the individual food items in a recipe. 
Stop_Throwing-28|This recipe uses only six main ingredients. 
Stop_Throwing-29|Spices and herbs. 
Stop_Throwing-30|The recipe appears in milk street book. 
Stop_Throwing-31|Cookies. 
Stop_Throwing-32|The main ingredients are cherry tomatoes. 
Stop_Throwing-33|Onion. 
Stop_Throwing-34|Italian dry salami. 
Stop_Throwing-35|Fontina cheese. 
Stop_Throwing-36|And of course pasta. 
Stop_Throwing-37|Salami is a salty dry meat. 
Stop_Throwing-38|For people who do not eat meat. 
Stop_Throwing-39|You could use mushrooms instead. 
Stop_Throwing-40|Kimball cuts the salami into small cubes. 
Stop_Throwing-41|This lets them cook evenly in the pot. 
Stop_Throwing-42|He also puts the fontina cheese into small cubes. 
Stop_Throwing-43|And adds them at the end. 
Stop_Throwing-44|The cheese makes the dish rich. 
Stop_Throwing-45|Any other cheese that melts easily can also be used. 
Stop_Throwing-46|The dish kimball says is a tasty meal that takes less than 30 minutes to make. 
Stop_Throwing-47|It uses just one pot. 
Stop_Throwing-48|So cleanup is also quick. 
Stop_Throwing-49|One pot pasta with tomatoes salami and fontina. 
Stop_Throwing-50|From start to finish this dish takes about 25 minutes to make. 
Stop_Throwing-51|It serves four to six people. 
Stop_Throwing-52|Here are the ingredients. 
Stop_Throwing-53|All measurements are approximate. 
Stop_Throwing-54|12.5 extra virgin olive oil. 
Stop_Throwing-55|113g salami cut into small cubes. 
Stop_Throwing-56|One cherry or grape tomatoes. 
Stop_Throwing-57|One medium onion cut into small pieces. 
Stop_Throwing-58|5 g fennel seeds. 
Stop_Throwing-59|Kosher salt and ground pepper. 
Stop_Throwing-60|To taste. 
Stop_Throwing-61|454 g of pasta. 
Stop_Throwing-62|112g fontina cheese. 
Stop_Throwing-63|Or some other cheese that melts. 
Stop_Throwing-64|Cut into small cubes. 
Stop_Throwing-65|In a large pot heat the oil. 
Stop_Throwing-66|Add the salami and cook until it turns brown. 
Stop_Throwing-67|Other tomatoes. 
Stop_Throwing-68|Onion. 
Stop_Throwing-69|Fennel seeds and a small amount of black pepper. 
Stop_Throwing-70|Cook until most of the tomatoes have opened. 
Stop_Throwing-71|Add about a liter of water. 
Stop_Throwing-72|Salt. 
Stop_Throwing-73|And bring to a boil. 
Stop_Throwing-74|Stir in the uncooked pasta. 
Stop_Throwing-75|Cover and cook mixing around every few minutes. 
Stop_Throwing-76|Make sure the water continues boiling. 
Stop_Throwing-77|When the pasta is still a bit firm pour out the water and save a couple. 
Stop_Throwing-78|Move the pot off the heated surface. 
Stop_Throwing-79|Mixon the fontina cheese. 
Stop_Throwing-80|Then season with salt and pepper. 
Stop_Throwing-81|Add some of the pasta water is needed to thicken the sauce. 
Stop_Throwing-82|If you like. 
Stop_Throwing-83|You can add freshly cut parsley or cilantro on top. 
Stop_Throwing-84|This is just one pasta recipe. 
Stop_Throwing-85|But you can use the pasta water. 
Stop_Throwing-86|With just about any pasta dish. 
Stop_Throwing-87|And any sauce. 
Stop_Throwing-88|So remember. 
Stop_Throwing-89|Don't throw out all the pasta water.

Students_Learning-2|For students that show a high level of success. 
Students_Learning-3|Such programs have been under much criticism in recent years. 
Students_Learning-4|Some parents say they worsened racial segregation. 
Students_Learning-5|And inequities. 
Students_Learning-6|In the country's education system. 
Students_Learning-7|Early october the mayor of new york city. 
Students_Learning-8|Announced plans to end the gifted and talented program. 
Students_Learning-9|In the country's largest school system. 
Students_Learning-10|If it goes forward. 
Students_Learning-11|That would be a big win for groups supporting an end to similar programs. 
Students_Learning-12|From boston massachusetts. 
Students_Learning-13|To seattle washington. 
Students_Learning-14|From the start. 
Students_Learning-15|Gifted and talented school programs. 
Students_Learning-16|True worries they would produce an unequal education system in us public schools. 
Students_Learning-17|Many programs began as efforts to keep white families. 
Students_Learning-18|From leaving racially diverse public schools. 
Students_Learning-19|In urban areas. 
Students_Learning-20|They were created to compete with high-performing private schools. 
Students_Learning-21|School leaders and parents. 
Students_Learning-22|Increasingly have to deal with difficult questions over equity. 
Students_Learning-23|They are trying to find ways. 
Students_Learning-24|To teach strong learners. 
Students_Learning-25|Well continuing to help other students succeed. 
Students_Learning-26|It is a question that is driving the debate. 
Students_Learning-27|Over whether to grow gifted and talented programs. 
Students_Learning-28|Or end them completely. 
Students_Learning-29|I get the burn it down and tear it down mentality. 
Students_Learning-30|But what do we replace it with. 
Students_Learning-31|Ask marsha gentry. 
Students_Learning-32|She is a professor of education. 
Students_Learning-33|And the director of the gifted education research and resource institute. 
Students_Learning-34|At purdue university in indiana. 
Students_Learning-35|Gentry co-wrote a study two years ago. 
Students_Learning-36|That followed the racial inequities in gifted and talented programs. 
Students_Learning-37|The study found that us schools identified 3.3 million students as gifted and talented. 
Students_Learning-38|But an additional 3.6 million who should have also been considered gifted. 
Students_Learning-39|We're not included in the programs. 
Students_Learning-40|The study found these students were disproportionately black latino. 
Students_Learning-41|And native american. 
Students_Learning-42|An associated press study of recent federal data. 
Students_Learning-43|Found that nationwide. 
Students_Learning-44|8.1% of whites. 
Students_Learning-45|And 12.7% of asian-american children in public schools. 
Students_Learning-46|Are considered gifted. 
Students_Learning-47|But only 4.5% of hispanic. 
Students_Learning-48|And 3.5% of black students are identified as gifted. 
Students_Learning-49|Gifted and talented programs. 
Students_Learning-50|Aim to provide more demanding instruction. 
Students_Learning-51|For students who feel limited with the regular program. 
Students_Learning-52|Critics of the push to end them. 
Students_Learning-53|Say it punishes successful students. 
Students_Learning-54|They say it also cuts off a chance for students to move up. 
Students_Learning-55|Especially for those from poor families. 
Students_Learning-56|Without the means to attend private schools. 
Students_Learning-57|In seattle. 
Students_Learning-58|A former top official of the school system. 
Students_Learning-59|Tried to end its gifted and talented program. 
Students_Learning-60|She blamed it for worsening school segregation. 
Students_Learning-61|In its own recent study. 
Students_Learning-62|Seattle public schools found only 0.9% of black children. 
Students_Learning-63|Had been identified as gifted. 
Students_Learning-64|Compared with 12.6% of its white students. 
Students_Learning-65|School leaders have since approved changes to the program. 
Students_Learning-66|Students will be admitted based on their performance. 
Students_Learning-67|They are no longer required to take a test to enter the program. 
Students_Learning-68|The selection committee will also consider input from teachers. 
Students_Learning-69|Family and community members. 
Students_Learning-70|Rita green works for the local n-double-acp office. 
Students_Learning-71|A racial justice organization. 
Students_Learning-72|She said the changes do not go far enough. 
Students_Learning-73|She wants it the schools to help all of the city's 50,000 students. 
Students_Learning-74|Not stressed the most successful. 
Students_Learning-75|We wants the program just abolished green said. 
Students_Learning-76|She added that the program is inherently racist. 
Students_Learning-77|Since the killing of george floyd in minneapolis. 
Students_Learning-78|Other school systems around the us. 
Students_Learning-79|Are also rethinking their gifted and talented programs. 
Students_Learning-80|Boston schools voted to expand its program. 
Students_Learning-81|And guarantee placements for top students from poorer areas of the city. 
Students_Learning-82|A top high school in san francisco california. 
Students_Learning-83|Removed its entrance exam. 
Students_Learning-84|As did a top high school in fairfax virginia. 
Students_Learning-85|We're parents recently lost a legal fight to keep the test. 
Students_Learning-86|Most gifted and talented programs have used test scores to decide which students to admit. 
Students_Learning-87|Some wealthier families are able to spend thousands of dollars on instruction. 
Students_Learning-88|To increase their child's scores. 
Students_Learning-89|Nowhere has the debate been as heated as in new york city. 
Students_Learning-90|Mayor bill de blasio said last month that he would begin to end the program. 
Students_Learning-91|Calling it exclusionary. 
Students_Learning-92|Eric adams likely the city's next mayor. 
Students_Learning-93|Said he does not support ending the program. 
Students_Learning-94|What's gentry the purdue researcher. 
Students_Learning-95|Agreed that it was time to fix the equity problems of gifted and talented programs. 
Students_Learning-96|She urged parents and school officials. 
Students_Learning-97|To do the hard work of finding a compromise. 
Students_Learning-98|I know the inequities exist gentry said. 
Students_Learning-99|I worry that the easy solution is to stop doing it. 
Students_Learning-100|I'm doing yoga. 
Students_Unprepared-1|Andrea hernandez is a student at the university of texas. 
Students_Unprepared-2|As a high school student in dallas she studied math a lot and was proud of her skill in the subject. 
Students_Unprepared-3|But when schools around the us closed because of the covid-19 pandemic. 
Students_Unprepared-4|In march 2020. 
Students_Unprepared-5|Students started learning by video link and on computers. 
Students_Unprepared-6|Hernandez found it hard to make progress. 
Students_Unprepared-7|By then she was studying in a class called precalculus. 
Students_Unprepared-8|After more than one year of learning by video link. 
Students_Unprepared-9|She had to take a calculus test. 
Students_Unprepared-10|Before starting school at the university of texas. 
Students_Unprepared-11|She did not do well. 
Students_Unprepared-12|As a result she had to start her college education. 
Students_Unprepared-13|In a lower level math class. 
Students_Unprepared-14|Hernandez got a top grade of a. 
Students_Unprepared-15|But she told the hechinger report. 
Students_Unprepared-16|That she lost some belief in her math ability. 
Students_Unprepared-17|Now she looks at calculus questions and thanks. 
Students_Unprepared-18|I don't understand anything. 
Students_Unprepared-19|I'll just sit there she said. 
Students_Unprepared-20|Kind of lost. 
Students_Unprepared-21|College professors around the country. 
Students_Unprepared-22|Are saying there are many students like hernandez. 
Students_Unprepared-23|These students had trouble learning. 
Students_Unprepared-24|When the pandemic changed the way they experienced school. 
Students_Unprepared-25|After two years. 
Students_Unprepared-26|Many students said they are less prepared for college than they hoped to be. 
Students_Unprepared-27|Some say they have forgotten how to be students. 
Students_Unprepared-28|Ori treistman. 
Students_Unprepared-29|Is hernandez professor at the university of texas. 
Students_Unprepared-30|He told hechinger report. 
Students_Unprepared-31|That his students. 
Students_Unprepared-32|Are making basic mistakes that he would not expect. 
Students_Unprepared-33|About 25% did not pass his class in the autumn of 2021. 
Students_Unprepared-34|Usually he said. 
Students_Unprepared-35|5% fail the class. 
Students_Unprepared-36|Trieschmann said it was hard to see so many students have problems. 
Students_Unprepared-37|Their failure is my failure he said. 
Students_Unprepared-38|She is also worried about his students whose families do not make a lot of money. 
Students_Unprepared-39|They might not have the same ability to get extra help. 
Students_Unprepared-40|The wealthy are concerned a nervous about the futures of their children. 
Students_Unprepared-41|And they're investing heavily in ensuring their children have an advantage he said. 
Students_Unprepared-42|The professor said it is normal for students to come to the university with different skill levels. 
Students_Unprepared-43|But they are usually able to catch up. 
Students_Unprepared-44|During the last two years it has been harder because students are distracted. 
Students_Unprepared-45|In different ways than in the past. 
Students_Unprepared-46|For example hernandez is grandfather who lived in mexico. 
Students_Unprepared-47|Died of covid-19. 
Students_Unprepared-48|She learned about it in the middle of her computer math class. 
Students_Unprepared-49|It became hard for her to think about school. 
Students_Unprepared-50|When family members were sick. 
Students_Unprepared-51|And others had financial problems. 
Students_Unprepared-52|Another of treisman's students. 
Students_Unprepared-53|Had to drive into texas from his home in mexico to go to high school. 
Students_Unprepared-54|When the pandemic close schools at leo hum school had to work from home in the border city of matamoros mexico. 
Students_Unprepared-55|At that point. 
Students_Unprepared-56|Amsco said his classes were not as good. 
Students_Unprepared-57|He called them watered down. 
Students_Unprepared-58|He still received good grades but when it was time to take an exam before college. 
Students_Unprepared-59|He did not get a good score. 
Students_Unprepared-60|In college he failed his first college calculus exam. 
Students_Unprepared-61|Before forming a study group. 
Students_Unprepared-62|After that. 
Students_Unprepared-63|He received an a in treisman's class. 
Students_Unprepared-64|Kristen patterson is an associate professor of genetics at the university of texas. 
Students_Unprepared-65|She said in past years. 
Students_Unprepared-66|Only two to four percent of students do not get through her class. 
Students_Unprepared-67|But last year about 20% did not pass. 
Students_Unprepared-68|Patterson said. 
Students_Unprepared-69|The university does not fully understand. 
Students_Unprepared-70|How the pandemic changed learning for students. 
Students_Unprepared-71|When they were in high school. 
Students_Unprepared-72|But it is slowly getting more information. 
Students_Unprepared-73|When students are able to work with the teacher in the classroom she said. 
Students_Unprepared-74|The teacher can judge a student's progress. 
Students_Unprepared-75|When they are at home that information is limited. 
Students_Unprepared-76|In addition some high schools permitted students to move on and their studies. 
Students_Unprepared-77|Even with poor grades. 
Students_Unprepared-78|When students came back to school. 
Students_Unprepared-79|Some did not have to take standardized tests. 
Students_Unprepared-80|That permitted teachers to find out how much they had learned. 
Students_Unprepared-81|In 2021 for example some states asked the us department of education. 
Students_Unprepared-82|For permission to change or cancel the test. 
Students_Unprepared-83|Patterson at the university of texas said some students did not understand the difference. 
Students_Unprepared-84|Between the large meetings and small-group discussions the former class. 
Students_Unprepared-85|Advent it. 
Students_Unprepared-86|Said students lack of preparation will continue. 
Students_Unprepared-87|He works at an education research company called esab. 
Students_Unprepared-88|He said. 
Students_Unprepared-89|Colleges must understand. 
Students_Unprepared-90|Set alarms number of incoming students have unfinished learning from high school. 
Students_Unprepared-91|For example. 
Students_Unprepared-92|At the university of maryland baltimore county. 
Students_Unprepared-93|The number of students having trouble with math classes is higher than in the past. 
Students_Unprepared-94|The university added classes to help students learn study skills. 
Students_Unprepared-95|And ways to plan their time. 
Students_Unprepared-96|Many college officials report that the students they accept. 
Students_Unprepared-97|Do not have lower grades than usual. 
Students_Unprepared-98|But many have not mastered the subjects as well as students in past years. 
Students_Unprepared-99|Over the last two years the us government has made billions of dollars of aid available for school systems across the country. 
Students_Unprepared-100|Schools are expected to find out why students are having problems learning. 
Students_Unprepared-101|This year in new york city. 
Students_Unprepared-102|The country's largest public school system. 
Students_Unprepared-103|Students are getting more tests than before the associated press reports. 
Students_Unprepared-104|Virginia's fairfax county school district. 
Students_Unprepared-105|Is using testing to provide more money to schools with lower test scores. 
Students_Unprepared-106|Ap reports chicago is using a system. 
Students_Unprepared-107|The places importance on a student's grades and rates of covid-19 and violent crime in their neighborhoods. 
Students_Unprepared-108|In boston lareina rivera. 
Students_Unprepared-109|Has two daughters who had trouble with math in the last 2 years. 
Students_Unprepared-110|Her daughters would often start their work and then stop. 
Students_Unprepared-111|There was a lot of giving up. 
Students_Unprepared-112|It was hard. 
Students_Unprepared-113|She said. 
Students_Unprepared-114|Early reports have been gathered. 
Students_Unprepared-115|From some of the biggest school districts in the country. 
Students_Unprepared-116|They suggest that student groups which already faced problems. 
Students_Unprepared-117|Including black. 
Students_Unprepared-118|Hispanic and poor students. 
Students_Unprepared-119|Appears to be behind in greater numbers. 
Students_Unprepared-120|But treisman said lowering standards is not the answer. 
Students_Unprepared-121|Sometimes he thinks he could make his classes easier. 
Students_Unprepared-122|The big risk you said. 
Students_Unprepared-123|Is that i give them a good grade. 
Students_Unprepared-124|And they're not prepared for what comes next. 
Students_Unprepared-125|He commented. 
Students_Unprepared-126|The students could graduate from college and be unprepared for their jobs. 
Students_Unprepared-127|Then it said he worries. 
Students_Unprepared-128|That students who come from poor families. 
Students_Unprepared-129|Or who are not white. 
Students_Unprepared-130|Or who are the first in their families to go to college. 
Students_Unprepared-131|Will have problems. 
Students_Unprepared-132|This is a rich gets richer situation and a poor stays for situation. 
Students_Unprepared-133|Bennett said. 
Students_Unprepared-134|He said that would reverse with those like him have been trying to do for 20 years. 
Students_Unprepared-135|He's sellafield. 
Students_Unprepared-136|Studies the data that comes from student tasks. 
Students_Unprepared-137|In a large school district near miami florida. 
Students_Unprepared-138|She said. 
Students_Unprepared-139|One year. 
Students_Unprepared-140|Will not be enough to correct all the problems. 
Students_Unprepared-141|The bottom line she said. 
Students_Unprepared-142|Is that we have such a loss. 
Students_Unprepared-143|That it will take some time. 
Students_Unprepared-144|I'm the infidel. 
Students_Unprepared-145|And i'm jill robbins. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-1|A nonprofit group recently announced an effort to get movie and television writers to use climate change more often in their stories and productions. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-2|The group. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-3|Good energy. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-4|Is a not-for-profit advising organization. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-5|It recently announced the release of good energy. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-6|A playbook for screenwriting in the age of climate change. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-7|Good energy found although many hollywood stars talk about the issue. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-8|Climate-change related words. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-9|Are not used a lot in movies. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-10|The group helped financially support research of words used in american films and television shows. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-11|Researchers looked at the words or transcripts. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-12|Used in. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-13|30 7453 films and tv shows. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-14|From 2016 to 2020. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-15|They found that. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-16|2.8% of fiction films. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-17|Used words related to climate change. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-18|The transcript research was carried out by the norman lear centers media impact project. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-19|At the university of. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-20|Southern california in los angeles. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-21|Part of the study has not been released. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-22|Researchers looked for links 236 words and phrases like. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-23|Climate change in tv shows and films. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-24|Released in the united states. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-25|Anna jane joyner is the head writer of the playbook and founder of good energy. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-26|She said the playbook was created with advice from. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-27|More than 100 film and television writers. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-28|She said it was a problem that writers were. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-29|Lincoln climate stories with disaster. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-30|She said. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-31|The main purpose of the playbook is to expand the possibilities. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-32|For writers to show how climate change would show up in real life. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-33|Joyner said her group is asking writers and industry leaders to consider stories. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-34|That are less disaster-related. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-35|She said they also should include examples and resources. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-36|Joyner said the group's website has a spectrum. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-37|With everything from the effects of climate change. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-38|Two possible answers. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-39|As an example she said. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-40|Movies could include shots showing. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-41|Solar panels on the outside of a building. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-42|Casually talking about climate change. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-43|Can also be effective she said. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-44|Bloomberg philanthropies the sierra club and the walton family foundation. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-45|Are among those providing financial support for the project. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-46|Dorothy fortenberry is a tv writer. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-47|She wrote the handmaid's tale. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-48|She said the industry needs to write about different kinds of people. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-49|Not just different subjects. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-50|Climate change is something that right now is affecting people. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-51|Who aren't necessarily the people that hollywood tends to write stories about. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-52|It's affecting farmers in bangladesh. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-53|Farmers in peru farmers in kentucky fortenberry said. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-54|She added. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-55|That if writers told stories about different kinds of people. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-56|There would be chances to easily include climate change. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-57|Joyner says she has worked on communications. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-58|Related to climate change in different industries for 15 years. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-59|She said for the first 10 years. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-60|It felt like. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-61|Screaming into the void. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-62|Because nobody answered. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-63|But there is evidence of increasing concern among americans about climate change she said. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-64|That includes those in hollywood. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-65|We've all gone through a kind of awakening she said. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-66|There are a number of documentaries films based on true events and. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-67|News programs about climate change. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-68|She said. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-69|She expressed hope that. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-70|Fiction creators. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-71|We'll make progress. 
Study_Hollywood_Missing-72|I'm the infidel. 
Study_Says-1|Researchers have found that about 321,000 undocumented and asylum-seeking children. 
Study_Says-2|From central america. 
Study_Says-3|Went to american schools from 2017. 
Study_Says-4|To 2019. 
Study_Says-5|The research was by the rand corporation. 
Study_Says-6|A nonprofit group based in california. 
Study_Says-7|During that same time.. 
Study_Says-8|The united states saw a large increase in undocumented immigrants entering the country through the southern border. 
Study_Says-9|Mostly from mexico el salvador. 
Study_Says-10|Guatemala and honduras the study says. 
Study_Says-11|The report estimates that 490 1000 of the immigrants who remained in the united states were children. 
Study_Says-12|Meaning just 65% enrolled in school. 
Study_Says-13|About 75 per-cent of the 321 thousand students. 
Study_Says-14|Went to school in 10 states. 
Study_Says-15|California texas florida. 
Study_Says-16|New york virginia. 
Study_Says-17|Maryland new jersey north carolina. 
Study_Says-18|Georgia and louisiana. 
Study_Says-19|When inside the country. 
Study_Says-20|Us federal law guarantees children in education. 
Study_Says-21|Without considering their immigration status. 
Study_Says-22|Us education secretary miguel cardona. 
Study_Says-23|Said he supports undocumented students right to a public education. 
Study_Says-24|That is a contrast from former education secretary betsy devos. 
Study_Says-25|Who testified to congress that school districts. 
Study_Says-26|Should be able to decide whether to report undocumented students to immigration officials. 
Study_Says-27|Cardona said in an interview with newsweek. 
Study_Says-28|That when there are students that are here that need to be educated. 
Study_Says-29|We have an obligation. 
Study_Says-30|Whether or not that means they have different rights. 
Study_Says-31|I'll leave that to others. 
Study_Says-32|But when it comes to education. 
Study_Says-33|Every student should get an education when they're here. 
Study_Says-34|Many states offer different levels of support to immigrants. 
Study_Says-35|Both documented and undocumented. 
Study_Says-36|As well as two refugees. 
Study_Says-37|That can affect the quality of their education. 
Study_Says-38|Argue the rand researchers. 
Study_Says-39|Some states give students more financial aid. 
Study_Says-40|Well some limit enrollments based on age. 
Study_Says-41|Some states give undocumented students access to lower in-state tuition. 
Study_Says-42|To public universities. 
Study_Says-43|But others do not. 
Study_Says-44|Undocumented asylum-seeking and refugee students. 
Study_Says-45|Face great difficulties while seeking an education. 
Study_Says-46|They can face trauma language barriers. 
Study_Says-47|Culture shock. 
Study_Says-48|And a lack of basic needs like food and shelter. 
Study_Says-49|Some have never had a formal education. 
Study_Says-50|The rand research focused on to districts that serve a large population of undocumented and asylum-seeking students. 
Study_Says-51|Jefferson parish schools in louisiana. 
Study_Says-52|And oakland unified school district in california. 
Study_Says-53|Both districts based teacher and worker shortages. 
Study_Says-54|But the study noted several ways the districts were able to meet the challenges. 
Study_Says-55|Faced by that population of students. 
Study_Says-56|The two districts provided language supports to students and families. 
Study_Says-57|And guaranteed in-person enrollment. 
Study_Says-58|The district also hired workers to help students with social and emotional needs. 
Study_Says-59|Many districts were not ready for the increase in undocumented students. 
Study_Says-60|The researchers say. 
Study_Says-61|Rand estimates that two thousand more teachers and workers. 
Study_Says-62|We needed in the seven states with the largest number of new students. 
Study_Says-63|To keep classes the same size. 
Study_Says-64|The study also points to a need for more teacher training. 
Study_Says-65|Mental health services. 
Study_Says-66|And funding to districts. 
Study_Says-67|With growing numbers of immigrants. 
Study_Says-68|The pandemic slowed all immigration to the united states in 2020. 
Study_Says-69|The study noted. 
Study_Says-70|But the us has experienced an unprecedented number of migrants at the southern border this year. 
Study_Says-71|Homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas. 
Study_Says-72|Told reporters in august. 
Study_Says-73|In addition. 
Study_Says-74|President joe biden has also asked congress. 
Study_Says-75|For funding to resettle 95,000 afghans. 
Study_Says-76|By september 20-22. 
Study_Says-77|Leslie villegas is an education researcher with the new america foundation. 
Study_Says-78|She said that fewer than half of u.s. states. 
Study_Says-79|Track students with limited formal education. 
Study_Says-80|Who are often undocumented immigrants. 
Study_Says-81|And refugees. 
Study_Says-82|Without that information villegas said. 
Study_Says-83|It can be hard to know what sort of resources. 
Study_Says-84|Districts need to support those students. 
Study_Says-85|Often these are kids who have experienced trauma. 
Study_Says-86|And face real barriers and how they interact with the education system. 
Study_Says-87|If they've ever interacted with the education system at all she said. 
Study_Says-88|I'm doing over. 
Study_Shows_British-1|British researchers say they have documented a case of a patient who had covid-19. 
Study_Shows_British-2|For 505 days. 
Study_Shows_British-3|Experts say they think the case represents the longest infection of covid-19. 
Study_Shows_British-4|On record. 
Study_Shows_British-5|The research was part of a study that looked at whether virus mutations can form in people who carry covid-19. 
Study_Shows_British-6|For a very long time. 
Study_Shows_British-7|The study involved nine patients who tested positive for the virus. 
Study_Shows_British-8|For at least 8 weeks. 
Study_Shows_British-9|All patients had weakened immune systems linked to organ replacement operations. 
Study_Shows_British-10|Hy-vee. 
Study_Shows_British-11|Cancer or other diseases. 
Study_Shows_British-12|Repeated tests showed that the patient's infections lasted an average of 73 days. 
Study_Shows_British-13|Two of them had the virus longer than a year. 
Study_Shows_British-14|Before the study the longest known covid-19 case was believed to have lasted 335 days. 
Study_Shows_British-15|Dr. luke blagdon snell helped lee the study. 
Study_Shows_British-16|He told the associated press the researchers considered the cases studied to be persistent covid-19. 
Study_Shows_British-17|This is different from what has been described as long covid-19. 
Study_Shows_British-18|With long covid-19 it is believed that the virus has been cleared from the patient's body. 
Study_Shows_British-19|But individuals can still experience signs or symptoms of disease. 
Study_Shows_British-20|Snell said. 
Study_Shows_British-21|A persistent infection represents ongoing active replication of the virus. 
Study_Shows_British-22|He added. 
Study_Shows_British-23|Each time researchers tested patients they examined the genetic code of the virus to make sure it was the same version or variant. 
Study_Shows_British-24|Results from the study showed that the virus could change and mutate over time. 
Study_Shows_British-25|Snell said the observed mutations were similar to ones that later showed up in widespread variants of covid-19. 
Study_Shows_British-26|But the team noted that none of the new mutations in the nine cases became variance of concern. 
Study_Shows_British-27|There was also no evidence that any of the patients had spread the virus to others. 
Study_Shows_British-28|Five of the nine patients studied survived. 
Study_Shows_British-29|Got rid of the infection without treatment. 
Study_Shows_British-30|To clear the infection after treatment and one still has covid-19. 
Study_Shows_British-31|The person with the longest known infection tested positive in early 2020. 
Study_Shows_British-32|And was treated with the drug remdesivir and died in 2021. 
Study_Shows_British-33|The study team refused to name the exact cause of the patient's death. 
Study_Shows_British-34|The researchers said the patient had other diseases along with covid-19. 
Study_Shows_British-35|Scientists hope to develop treatments to help people recover from persistent covid-19 infections. 
Study_Shows_British-36|We do need to be mindful that there are some people who are more susceptible to these problems like persistent infection and severe disease.

Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-1|A new study has found that all dogs have different personalities. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-2|Even dogs of the same breed. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-3|Eleanor carlson studies genetics at the university of massachusetts. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-4|She co-wrote a report about the study. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-5|Which appeared recently. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-6|In the publication science. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-7|Carlson said. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-8|Every dog really is an individual. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-9|Carlson noted there is a huge amount of variation. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-10|Even between dogs that look the same. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-11|At a new york dog park. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-12|Dog owners told the associated press about the different characteristics of their pets. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-13|Elizabeth kelly. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-14|Owns an english springer spaniel. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-15|She called her dog friendly. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-16|But also. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-17|Kind of the queen bee. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-18|In other words. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-19|Her dog likes to act. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-20|Like she is in charge of other dogs. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-21|Julie ortiz owens a yellow labrador. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-22|She described her dog is calm lazy and shy. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-23|Rachel kim has a dog that is a mix of several breeds. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-24|She described the animal as super independent. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-25|And loving. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-26|Dogs first became friendly to humans around 14,000 years ago. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-27|But the idea of dog breeds is much more recent. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-28|Around 160 years ago. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-29|Humans began to breed dogs. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-30|To have certain physical qualities. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-31|Such as. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-32|Fur texture and color and ear shape. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-33|Carlson said. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-34|Her aim was to learn how much a dog's breed. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-35|Affects their behavior. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-36|The answer. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-37|Breed does not decide and individual dog's personality. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-38|Carlson's team gathered information from. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-39|18000 dog owners and studied the genetic code of over 2,000 dogs. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-40|The researchers found that some qualities. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-41|Are based on genetics. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-42|However. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-43|There is no guarantee that to dogs. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-44|Of the same breed will behave in the same way. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-45|For example. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-46|They found golden retrievers. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-47|Do not retrieve. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-48|To retrieve is to get and bring something back from a place. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-49|Summit breeds such as huskies and beagles. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-50|Maybe more likely to howl. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-51|Or make a long loud barking sound. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-52|Many of these dogs. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-53|Do not howl. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-54|As owner observations showed. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-55|In addition. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-56|The researchers were not able to link aggression. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-57|To a certain breed. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-58|Jeff kidd studies genetics at the university of michigan. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-59|He was not involved in the dog project. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-60|He said. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-61|The connection between dog breed and behavior is much lower than most expected. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-62|Adam boyko studies genetics at cornell university. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-63|He also was not involved in the dog research. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-64|He noted that carlson and her team. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-65|Organized the most data ever about dogs. 
Study_Shows_Dog_Personalities-66|I'm dan friedel. 
Study_of_Cancer-1|Scientists have studied the full genetic information of more than 18,000 cancer samples. 
Study_of_Cancer-2|I found new information about the patterns of mutations. 
Study_of_Cancer-3|Or changes. 
Study_of_Cancer-4|That could help doctors provide better treatment. 
Study_of_Cancer-5|Their study which appeared recently in the publication science is not the first to do such a complete genetic study of cancer samples. 
Study_of_Cancer-6|But no one has ever used such a large sample size. 
Study_of_Cancer-7|Serena nix anal of the university of cambridge. 
Study_of_Cancer-8|Was part of the team that did the research. 
Study_of_Cancer-9|She said this was the largest cohort in the world. 
Study_of_Cancer-10|It is extraordinary. 
Study_of_Cancer-11|Over 12,000 samples in the study came from patients recruited by britain's national health service. 
Study_of_Cancer-12|They were part of a project to study whole genomes from people with common cancers and rare diseases. 
Study_of_Cancer-13|The rest of the data came from existing cancer datasets. 
Study_of_Cancer-14|Researchers were able to study such a large number. 
Study_of_Cancer-15|Because of the same improvements in technology that recently permitted scientists to complete the map of the entire human genome. 
Study_of_Cancer-16|Andrew futral a genomic expert at md anderson cancer center in houston was not involved in the study. 
Study_of_Cancer-17|He said the study give scientists some knowledge of the destructive forces that cause cancer. 
Study_of_Cancer-18|Cancer is a disease of the genome or full set of instructions for running cells. 
Study_of_Cancer-19|It happens when changes in a person's dna. 
Study_of_Cancer-20|Causes cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. 
Study_of_Cancer-21|Dna is a substance that carries the genetic information in the cells of living things. 
Study_of_Cancer-22|Like a human. 
Study_of_Cancer-23|In 2020. 
Study_of_Cancer-24|There were about 19 million new cancer cases worldwide. 
Study_of_Cancer-25|For the study researchers looked at 19 different kinds of cancer in the human body. 
Study_of_Cancer-26|It identified 58 new mutational signatures. 
Study_of_Cancer-27|Or pieces of evidence leading to the causes of cancer. 
Study_of_Cancer-28|Nyx anal said researchers also confirmed 51 of more than 70 previously reported mutation patterns. 
Study_of_Cancer-29|Summarize because of problems within a person's cells. 
Study_of_Cancer-30|Others are caused by ultraviolet radiation. 
Study_of_Cancer-31|Tobacco smoke. 
Study_of_Cancer-32|Or chemicals. 
Study_of_Cancer-33|Knowing more of them helps us to understand each person's cancer more precisely. 
Study_of_Cancer-34|Which can help guide treatment. 
Study_of_Cancer-35|Nick's anal set. 
Study_of_Cancer-36|Genetic sequencing. 
Study_of_Cancer-37|The process used to study the makeup of a cell. 
Study_of_Cancer-38|Is already being included in cancer care. 
Study_of_Cancer-39|It is part of the growing move toward personalized medicine. 
Study_of_Cancer-40|Or care based on a patient's genes and specific disease. 
Study_of_Cancer-41|Now doctors will have much more information to draw from when they look at individual cancers. 
Study_of_Cancer-42|To help doctors use this information. 
Study_of_Cancer-43|Researchers developed a computer program. 
Study_of_Cancer-44|That will let them find common mutation patterns. 
Study_of_Cancer-45|And seek out rare ones. 
Study_of_Cancer-46|Nick's anal said doctors could suggest a treatment. 
Study_of_Cancer-47|Based on a special pattern. 
Study_of_Cancer-48|Betrayal said today. can also show doctors what tends to happen over time when a patient develops a cancer with a certain mutation pattern. 
Study_of_Cancer-49|This will help doctors give earlier treatment and hopefully stop the developing disease.

Syrian_Migrants_Face_Cold_Danger_to_Reach_Europe-17|for example
Syrian_Migrants_Face_Cold_Danger_to_Reach_Europe-18|her father's job paid about $100 a month
Syrian_Migrants_Face_Cold_Danger_to_Reach_Europe-19|at the start of the war

Syrian_Migrants_Face_Cold_Danger_to_Reach_Europe-36|she did not give her last name
Syrian_Migrants_Face_Cold_Danger_to_Reach_Europe-37|she wanted to get to Safety in Germany so she started the trip
Syrian_Migrants_Face_Cold_Danger_to_Reach_Europe-38|the last part included

The_Chair-48|Robertson told reuters by email. 
The_Chair-49|He added. 
The_Chair-50|And there are uncertainties about the winter season. 
The_Chair-51|Britain has seen some increase in cases in schools that opened early on.

The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-1|The united states hydropower industry considers pumped-storage the best answer to a question surrounding renewable energy. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-2|Where to get power when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-3|Pumped-storage faces and unclear future. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-4|Even though experts predict growing demand for power storage. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-5|The industry's growth has slowed. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-6|Pumped-storage is when water is sent from a lower reservoir to an upper one. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-7|And released downhill through large machines known as turbines. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-8|Pumped-storage dates from the early 1930s. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-9|But most systems were built many years later to hold electricity from nuclear plants. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-10|Supporters called these systems the world's largest batteries because they hold large amounts of energy. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-11|The us has 43 pumped storage facilities that hold about 22 gigawatts. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-12|Yet. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-13|Just one small operation has been added since 1995. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-14|And it is unknown how many of more than 90 planned facilities. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-15|Can overcome economic. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-16|Legal. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-17|And practical issues that force long delays. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-18|Three projects have received permission from the federal energy regulatory commission. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-19|Serc. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-20|But none are being built. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-21|In contrast. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-22|More than 60 are being built worldwide. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-23|Mostly in europe. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-24|India. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-25|China and japan. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-26|Malcolm wolf. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-27|President of the national hydropower association. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-28|Complained during a january hearing of the senate energy and natural resources committee. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-29|He said official approval involves too many agencies. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-30|The process is crazy he said. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-31|Environmentalists are worried about pumped-storage because reservoirs typically are formed by a hydropower dams. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-32|Such dams can block fish movements. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-33|Damage water quality. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-34|And release methane a greenhouse gas. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-35|Also. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-36|Most plants continuously draw water from rivers. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-37|But recent designs include closed-loop systems that use a surface or underground supply. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-38|Then repeatedly cycle water between reservoirs. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-39|Water would be added only to make up for evaporation or leaks. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-40|Hydropower reform coalition. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-41|Representing environmental group. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-42|Says it might support such projects under very limited circumstances. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-43|Yet some are drawing resistance. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-44|Including the goldendale energy storage project. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-45|In washington state. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-46|It would send water between to 24.3 ha reservoirs. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-47|On opposite sides of a hill. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-48|The facility could power nearly 500,000 homes. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-49|Or up to 12 hours. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-50|According to ride development which is leading the project. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-51|It is seeking ferc approval. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-52|And is scheduled to go online in 2028. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-53|But still needs permission from washington state. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-54|Environmental groups fear harm to wetlands and wildlife. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-55|While native american tribes say the project would cross onto a secret area. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-56|What are we willing to sacrifice to get this technology online. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-57|Said bridget moran. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-58|An associate director of american rivers. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-59|Developers say the project would include cleanup of the polluted. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-60|Lower reservoir area. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-61|As the market for stored energy grows. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-62|New technologies are appearing. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-63|Texas-based quidnet energy for example. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-64|Has developed a pumped storage system that forces water underground. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-65|Holds it emit rock layers. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-66|And releases it to power turbines. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-67|For now batteries are the leading competitor to pumped-storage plants which can generate power for 8216 hours. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-68|Lithium-ion batteries usually last up to 4 hours. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-69|But longer-lasting ones are in the works. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-70|Are we going to get to the point where an eight-hour battery is cheaper than a pumped-storage plant. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-71|That's the billion-dollar question. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-72|Said paul denham. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-73|An expert with the national renewable energy laboratory. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-74|I 2016 energy department report. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-75|Said the us network could have 36 gigawatts of new pumped storage capacity. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-76|We don't think pumped-storage is the be-all-end-all. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-77|But it's a vital part of our storage future said cameron schilling. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-78|Vice president of marquette score the hydropower association. 
The_Worlds_Largest_Battery-79|You can't decarbonise the system without it.

Turkey_Moves_Trial-2|Woods 46. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-3|Suffered a serious injury to his right leg in a california car accident. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-4|In february 2021. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-5|Some reports said doctors thought of cutting off or amputating his leg instead of repairing it. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-6|Just 14 months later woods is back on the famous augusta national course. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-7|In the us state of georgia. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-8|Woods has been playing on the course since 1995. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-9|And won the masters tournament five times. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-10|Most recently in 2019. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-11|Last year's winner was hideki matsuyama of japan. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-12|Thousands of people watched woods hit his first shot. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-13|A big moment came on the 6th hole. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-14|When woods made birdie. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-15|Which means he finished with one shot fewer than required. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-16|Many observers who saw woods recently said he was playing well. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-17|They had one question. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-18|Can his leg handle 8 km of walking each day during the masters. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-19|That equals about 11,000 steps. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-20|Up and down the hill ecorse. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-21|Also. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-22|Golfers must hit shots from ground that is not flat. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-23|Or out of sand. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-24|Or pine needles. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-25|On tuesday woodside. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-26|Walking is the hard part.

Turkey_Moves_Trial-29|He always felt pain in his lower legs after playing augusta national. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-30|And he does not have metal plates and rods in his leg like woods. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-31|Woods said playing 72 holes is a tough challenge. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-32|That he was ready to face. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-33|Golfers play 18 holes a day over 4 days. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-34|At the masters. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-35|Woods has yet to play the course for more than one day since the accident. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-36|And it could be physically stressful for his leg. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-37|Healthy young players. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-38|Save the tournament comes with additional stress. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-39|Scottie scheffler is the top golfer in the world this year. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-40|He was a few months old when woods won his first masters 25 years ago. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-41|Schaeffler said. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-42|I think most of the stress that we have is probably more mental than physical. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-43|Woods however said he is more concerned about how his body will feel than his mind. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-44|For his body to feel better. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-45|Would just making one important change. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-46|His shoes. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-47|Woods has paid to wear golf shoes by nike. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-48|But this year. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-49|He is wearing more comfortable shoes from a different maker. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-50|Wood said he thinks he can play well enough to win. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-51|Otherwise he said. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-52|He would not play. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-53|I feel like i can still do it he said. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-54|I've been in worse situations and played and won tournaments edwards. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-55|Remembering the us open he won in 2008 with a serious knee injury. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-56|But he was only 32 then. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-57|Even compared walking the course with its hills. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-58|To a difficult marathon. 
Turkey_Moves_Trial-59|I'm the infidel. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-1|Twitter has accepted elon musk's offer to buy the social media service. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-2|In a deal worth about 44 billion dollars. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-3|Mosque the american billionaire who heads tesla and spacex. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-4|Has said his goal is to shape twitter. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-5|Into a more welcoming platform. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-6|For free speech. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-7|Twitter's board of directors voted this week. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-8|To accept musk's takeover offer. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-9|The deal could be finalized sometime this year. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-10|But it still has to be approved by twitter shareholders. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-11|As well as regulatory agencies in the united states. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-12|And other nations where twitter does business. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-13|Shortly after receiving musk's proposal. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-14|Twitter's board established an anti takeover position known as a poison pill. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-15|A poison pill is a financial tool used by companies to block. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-16|Unwelcome takeover attempts. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-17|A poison pill is generally designed to limit the number of shares that can be bought. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-18|By a single investor. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-19|Companies permit existing shareholders to buy additional stock. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-20|At a reduced rate. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-21|This method can flood the market with so many newly issued shares that a company takeover becomes too costly. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-22|However poison pills can also be used to improve a company's negotiating position in a takeover deal. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-23|Or they can invite additional offers for more money. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-24|In twitter's case the poison pill seemed designed to prevent musk from raising his existing share in the company above 15%. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-25|Without negotiating a deal with its board. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-26|Reuters news agency reported. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-27|Musk answered that position by offering detailed information about his financing plans. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-28|These plans show that he successfully raised. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-29|46.5 billion dollars to finance his offer. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-30|The amount included 21 billion dollars of musk's personal wealth. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-31|Musk has been declared the world's richest person by forbes magazine. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-32|Industry experts say the financing plan showed how serious must was about his offer. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-33|And it may have opened the door to other large twitter shareholders. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-34|Interested in hearing more about his plans for the company. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-35|John mayer is a technology expert and investor. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-36|He told the associated press. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-37|He thinks there is nothing better for twitter than elon musk buying it. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-38|Meyer said he expects musk to replace twitter's current board. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-39|Invest in new products. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-40|And find new ways to improve profits. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-41|Musk has the track record that he can do the impossible. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-42|Meyer said. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-43|Government regulators both in the us and the european union. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-44|Are likely to examine the proposed to twitter deal. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-45|The main issues to be considered or how the deal could affect competition in the industry. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-46|And whether it violates antitrust laws. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-47|Twitter shareholders also need to approve the deal. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-48|A company can choose to hold a vote at any time. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-49|Even before regulators have completed their examinations. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-50|Twitter's yearly meeting is set for may 25th so it is possible the vote could happen then. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-51|In the past must has been critical of some of twitter's policies related to free speech issues. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-52|Since seeking to take control of the company he has promised to improve and fix twitter. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-53|And make it better than ever. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-54|This includes his stated plans to take steps to ensure free speech for all individuals. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-55|But he has not provided many details on those plans. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-56|Some industry experts fear must desire to establish a free speech platform without limits. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-57|Could lead to more misinformation and hate speech appearing on twitter. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-58|Current twitter policies against such content. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-59|Can result in users being restricted or banned from the service. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-60|Michael nathanson is an analyst at stock research company moffitt nathan son. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-61|He told reuters that possible attempts by musk. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-62|Twohey's content restrictions. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-63|Could turn advertisers away. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-64|We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on twitter. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-65|If elon musk removed content moderation in order to promote free speech. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-66|Nathanson said. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-67|If that happens he added. 
Twitter_Accepts_Elon-68|Advertisers on twitter may move to platforms like google.

US_Considers_La-1|a top Federal Reserve official
US_Considers_La-2|said the United States is moving forward with a plan to develop a central bank digital currency
US_Considers_La-3|or cbdc
US_Considers_La-4|the US would not be the first country to consider launching such a currency
US_Considers_La-5|China is also considering one
US_Considers_La-6|however the US dollar is very important in the world economy
US_Considers_La-7|supporters of a cbdc
US_Considers_La-8|say it makes electronic payments faster and simpler
US_Considers_La-9|they say there is no need for a bank to take part in The Exchange
US_Considers_La-10|and people without a bank account
US_Considers_La-11|could receive secure electronic payments
US_Considers_La-12|but critics have concerns about privacy
US_Considers_La-13|they say such a system could give the federal government's control over people's Financial transactions
US_Considers_La-14|there are also economic concerns that the digital dollar could displace the currencies of smaller countries
US_Considers_La-15|David Treat
US_Considers_La-16|is with the Irish company Accenture
US_Considers_La-17|which gives business advice
US_Considers_La-18|he has worked with most central banks in G20 countries
US_Considers_La-19|20 large industrialized nations
US_Considers_La-20|he thinks about five of them will have some kind of digital currency by 2024
US_Considers_La-21|China's digital yuan is already in limited use
US_Considers_La-22|experts believe that CBD seas are likely to be used in the future
US_Considers_La-23|here are some strengths and weaknesses of digital currencies
US_Considers_La-24|a digital US dollar
US_Considers_La-25|would be worth exactly $1
US_Considers_La-26|other digital currencies like Bitcoin
US_Considers_La-27|can gain or lose value quickly compared to national currencies
US_Considers_La-28|but the digital token
US_Considers_La-29|held by the owner
US_Considers_La-30|would be guaranteed by the US Federal Reserve
US_Considers_La-31|Bitcoin for example is backed by no government
US_Considers_La-32|Tariq said
US_Considers_La-33|there is no question as to its value
US_Considers_La-34|whether it's the dollar in your wallet
US_Considers_La-35|the dollar in your savings account
US_Considers_La-36|or the Central Bank digital currency version of $1 in your digital wallet
US_Considers_La-37|all of them always equals $1
US_Considers_La-38|digital currencies involve fewer steps in a transaction
US_Considers_La-39|digital transactions on services like venmo seem simple
US_Considers_La-40|but there is a complex digital Network behind them
US_Considers_La-41|Banks and other Financial Services exchange information
US_Considers_La-42|to make sure the transaction is safe
US_Considers_La-43|if one step goes wrong
US_Considers_La-44|the payment can be delayed
US_Considers_La-45|experts say a digital currency
US_Considers_La-46|would work like cash
US_Considers_La-47|all the information needed to verify the transaction exists in the digital wallet
US_Considers_La-48|two people could even make a transaction without an internet connection
US_Considers_La-49|although a wireless connection is still required
US_Considers_La-50|a digital dollar could also be used around the world and across borders
US_Considers_La-51|Daniel dorfen
US_Considers_La-52|is a director of the digital dollar project
US_Considers_La-53|a nonprofit organization that supports a digital dollar
US_Considers_La-54|he said a digital dollar would reduce cost
US_Considers_La-55|for cross-border exchanges
US_Considers_La-56|smartphones are widely used in some of the world's poorest countries
US_Considers_La-57|cbdcs could bring many people around the world into the digital economy
US_Considers_La-58|gorfine said
US_Considers_La-59|the experiences of countries like Kenya
US_Considers_La-60|show that digital access can have a strongly inclusive effect
US_Considers_La-61|on underserved populations
US_Considers_La-62|however
US_Considers_La-63|digital currencies are a cause for concern
US_Considers_La-64|for supporters of personal privacy
US_Considers_La-65|under a digital dollar system
US_Considers_La-66|the Federal Reserve would have control over many transactions by citizens
US_Considers_La-67|critics point to China
US_Considers_La-68|where the government uses digital currency
US_Considers_La-69|to watch citizens transactions
US_Considers_La-70|a digital dollar
US_Considers_La-71|could also weaken local currencies
US_Considers_La-72|it might be good for individual people
US_Considers_La-73|to be able to buy and sell Goods in US dollars
US_Considers_La-74|but it would be bad for countries trying to supervise their own National currencies
US_Considers_La-75|a strong digital dollar
US_Considers_La-76|would reduce the value of a local currency
US_Considers_La-77|it would also harm other central banks ability to control their money supplies
US_Considers_La-78|gorfine said it is a problem that must be dealt with
US_Considers_La-79|he said it could be a good idea to limit the amount of digital dollars a person can hold at one time
US_Considers_La-80|he added that as digital currencies get more popular
US_Considers_La-81|it is important that they be supported by strong democracies
US_Considers_La-82|in the long-term
US_Considers_La-83|it is a good thing for any digital currency to be underpinned by rule of law

US_High_Court-1|The us supreme court agreed on monday. 
US_High_Court-2|To hear a case that could help decide. 
US_High_Court-3|How artists can use the works of others. 
US_High_Court-4|The court agreed to decide a copyright dispute. 
US_High_Court-5|Between the photographer lynn goldsmith. 
US_High_Court-6|And the estate of modern artist andy warhol. 
US_High_Court-7|The dispute is over warhol's 1984 paintings of music star prince. 
US_High_Court-8|The justices agreed to hear the andy warhol foundation xappeal. 
US_High_Court-9|Of a lower-court ruling. 
US_High_Court-10|That ruling held that warhol's paintings based on a picture of prince by goldsmith. 
US_High_Court-11|We're not protected by the fair use idea of us copyright law. 
US_High_Court-12|The photos were taken for newsweek magazine. 
US_High_Court-13|In 1981. 
US_High_Court-14|Goldsmith who is now 74 years old. 
US_High_Court-15|Countersued warhol's estate in 2017. 
US_High_Court-16|Over warhol's unlicensed paintings of prince. 
US_High_Court-17|Warhol's is stage. 
US_High_Court-18|Had asked a federal court in new york city. 
US_High_Court-19|To find that his works did not violate her copyright. 
US_High_Court-20|Warhol was famous for basing some of his art on photographs. 
US_High_Court-21|And available images. 
US_High_Court-22|He died in 1987. 
US_High_Court-23|Goldsmith has said she did not learn about the unlicensed works. 
US_High_Court-24|Until after prince died in 2016. 
US_High_Court-25|She asked the court to block warhol's estate. 
US_High_Court-26|From making more use of her work. 
US_High_Court-27|She also wants to be paid what are called damages. 
US_High_Court-28|For use of her work. 
US_High_Court-29|A judge had earlier ruled that warhol's works were protected against goldsmith's claims. 
US_High_Court-30|By the idea of fair use. 
US_High_Court-31|Under fair use copyrighted work may be used without the owner's permission. 
US_High_Court-32|If several ideas of fairness are observed. 
US_High_Court-33|For example. 
US_High_Court-34|Syracuse is permitted if the artist changes or transforms. 
US_High_Court-35|The work into something new. 
US_High_Court-36|Fair use is also permitted. 
US_High_Court-37|If the new work is a parody. 
US_High_Court-38|The judge found warhol's paintings transformed goldsmith's picture of prince. 
US_High_Court-39|As a vulnerable human being. 
US_High_Court-40|By showing him as an iconic. 
US_High_Court-41|Larger-than-life figure. 
US_High_Court-42|Goldsmith disputed that earlier decision. 
US_High_Court-43|The case then came before the second us circuit court of appeals in new york. 
US_High_Court-44|Last year the courts decided that warhol's paintings had not made fair use of goldsmiths photo. 
US_High_Court-45|That made it possible for goldsmith's case to continue. 
US_High_Court-46|The second circuit decided that a transformative work must have a fundamentally different and new artistic purpose and character. 
US_High_Court-47|The court said that warhol's paintings. 
US_High_Court-48|We're much closer to presenting the same work in a different form. 
US_High_Court-49|The andy warhol foundation then asked the us supreme court in december to overturn the second circuit decision. 
US_High_Court-50|The foundation argued that the decision created legal uncertainty. 
US_High_Court-51|For all art like warhol's. 
US_High_Court-52|Warhol foundation lawyer roman martinez. 
US_High_Court-53|Said he welcomed the high court's decision to hear the case. 
US_High_Court-54|He hopes it will recognize that andy warhol's transformative works of art. 
US_High_Court-55|Are fully protected by law. 
US_High_Court-56|Goldsmith said in a statement provided by one of her lawyers. 
US_High_Court-57|That she looks forward to continuing her legal fight at the supreme court. 
US_High_Court-58|I fought the suit to protect not only my own rights. 
US_High_Court-59|But the rights of all photographers and visual artists. 
US_High_Court-60|To make a living by licensing their creative work. 
US_High_Court-61|And also to decide when how. 
US_High_Court-62|And even whether to exploit their creative works. 
US_High_Court-63|We're license others to do so. 
US_High_Court-64|Goldsmith said. 
US_High_Court-65|The supreme court dealt with the issue of copyright fair use last year. 
US_High_Court-66|One of its rulings found that the use of oracle corporation software code by google and its android operating system was protected. 
US_High_Court-67|In a 1994 supreme court ruling on fair use involving artistic creation. 
US_High_Court-68|The justices found that rap music group 2 live crew's parody of a song by performer roy orbison. 
US_High_Court-69|What's fair use. 
US_High_Court-70|I'm doing novak.

US_Parents-62|She said the us supreme court ruled in 1982. 
US_Parents-63|That local school boards may not remove books from school library shelves. 
US_Parents-64|Simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books. 
US_Parents-65|However eidelman said. 
US_Parents-66|School officials are permitted to ban books for reasons other than not approving of the ideas in the books. 
US_Parents-67|Officials might decide for example. 
US_Parents-68|That's the book uses too much vulgar language. 
US_Parents-69|But the meaning of vulgarity can change and be unclear she said. 
US_Parents-70|And that can be used by the government to ban books.

US_Restricts-1|American health officials have placed strong restrictions. 
US_Restricts-2|On the use of johnson & johnson's covid-19 vaccine. 
US_Restricts-3|The treatment carries a risk of rare but serious blood clots. 
US_Restricts-4|The united states food and drug administration or fda said the j&j shot. 
US_Restricts-5|Should only be given to adults who cannot or will not accept a different covid vaccine. 
US_Restricts-6|Us health officials have suggested for months. 
US_Restricts-7|But americans get by their biontech or moderna shots. 
US_Restricts-8|Instead of j & j's vaccine. 
US_Restricts-9|Fda vaccine chief dr. peter mark. 
US_Restricts-10|Said the agency acted after examining the data on the risk of life-threatening blood clots. 
US_Restricts-11|The fda found that the risk is limited to j & j's shot. 
US_Restricts-12|In the first 2 weeks after vaccination. 
US_Restricts-13|So if you had the vaccine 6 months ago you can sleep soundly tonight. 
US_Restricts-14|Knowing this isn't an issue mark said. 
US_Restricts-15|But he added. 
US_Restricts-16|Compared to novak scene this is still a better option. 
US_Restricts-17|The fda approved j&j shot in february last year for adults. 
US_Restricts-18|The vaccine was considered an important tool in fighting the pandemic. 
US_Restricts-19|Because it required only one shot. 
US_Restricts-20|But the single shot vaccine proved less effective than those from pfizer and moderna. 
US_Restricts-21|In december the us centers for disease control and prevention. 
US_Restricts-22|Suggested motor anna and pfizer shots. 
US_Restricts-23|/ j & j's. 
US_Restricts-24|Because of its safety issues. 
US_Restricts-25|As of mid march. 
US_Restricts-26|Federal scientists had identified 60 cases of the side effect. 
US_Restricts-27|Including nine that resulted in.. 
US_Restricts-28|That amounts to 3.23 blood clot cases per 1 million j&j shots. 
US_Restricts-29|The problem is more common in women under 50. 
US_Restricts-30|Where the death rate was around one in 1 million shot. 
US_Restricts-31|Marc's ad. 
US_Restricts-32|The j&j covid vaccine will carry a warning about possible long-term and debilitating health consequences. 
US_Restricts-33|Of the side effect. 
US_Restricts-34|Under the new fda orders. 
US_Restricts-35|Jnj stock seen could still be given to people who had bad reactions to the other covid vaccines. 
US_Restricts-36|J&j shot could also be given to people who refuse to receive the mrna vaccines. 
US_Restricts-37|From pfizer biontech and moderna. 
US_Restricts-38|A j & j spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. 
US_Restricts-39|Data continue to support a favorable benefit-risk profile. 
US_Restricts-40|For the johnson & johnson covid-19 vaccine in adults. 
US_Restricts-41|When compared with no vaccine. 
US_Restricts-42|The blood-clot problems were first reported last spring with the j&j shot in the us. 
US_Restricts-43|And with an astrazeneca vaccine used elsewhere. 
US_Restricts-44|At that time us health officials decided the benefit of j & j's vaccine. 
US_Restricts-45|Wait what was considered a very rare risk. 
US_Restricts-46|Symptoms of the rare blood clots include severe headache. 
US_Restricts-47|A week or two after the j&j vaccinations. 
US_Restricts-48|As well as stomach pain and nausea. 
US_Restricts-49|Kaiser and murder not have provided a large majority of covid-19 vaccines in the us. 
US_Restricts-50|More than 200 million americans have been fully vaccinated. 
US_Restricts-51|With the companies. 
US_Restricts-52|Two shot maxine.

US_Schools-25|To attack books that go against their views. 
US_Schools-26|These include books that have a sexual nature. 
US_Schools-27|Or deal with racism in a way that offends some white people.

US_Schools-39|As well as the speech they agree with. 
US_Schools-40|If we cancel or censor everything that people find a pensive. 
US_Schools-41|Nothing will be left. 
US_Schools-42|Sad. 
US_Schools-43|Raskin pointed to criticism from the left seeking to remove mark twain's the adventures of huckleberry finn. 
US_Schools-44|They want to remove it because it uses a racially offensive word. 
US_Schools-45|But the overall meaning of the book is against racism and slavery. 
US_Schools-46|10 found that 86 school district.

US_Schools_Pull_More-1|American students had been learning from home. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-2|For more than a year during the pandemic. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-3|When they returned to in-person learning. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-4|Teachers began to see more behavioral problems. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-5|Sarah patinka is an art teacher at putnam high school in connecticut. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-6|She said coming back into the building. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-7|A lot of kids fell out of the good habits. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-8|They had built up in previous years. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-9|Prospectus said she saw more fights and arguments among students online and in-person. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-10|Some refuse to wear the required face coverings. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-11|Other students broke school rules by leaving in the middle of class. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-12|To meet up with friends. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-13|Obviously throughout this pandemic the students spent a lot of time at home. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-14|And because of that they lack in those social skills. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-15|Said danielle trejo. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-16|She is a school counselor in austin texas. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-17|Bad behavior among students is part of what experts are calling a mental health crisis among children. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-18|Even before the pandemic. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-19|Research found that bad behavior in the classroom was increasing. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-20|Childhood depression is also a serious problem. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-21|A group of mental health organizations says in a recent hopeful futures campaign report. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-22|That one in three students reported feeling lonely or hopeless. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-23|Half of all mental illness presents by the age of 14. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-24|But few students get the services they need. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-25|The report released last month. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-26|Also warns that suicide is the second leading cause of death among those aged 14 to 18. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-27|In 2019. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-28|Richard douglas is a school psychologist at putnam high school with over 30 years of experience. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-29|He agrees that the mental health crisis existed before the pandemic. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-30|Douglas said that during the pandemic there have been many things that disrupt families. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-31|More time at home could lead to more arguments with family members. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-32|A parents or family member could have gotten sick with covid or lost a job. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-33|Leading to more stress. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-34|Douglas said. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-35|At putnam many students also work to help pay for housing costs. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-36|Douglas field's school officials provide enough support to deal with the crisis at putnam. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-37|For the school of around just 250 students. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-38|There is also a counselor. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-39|Social worker and two recently hired interventionist. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-40|Interventionists help identify learning and behavioral problems among students. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-41|But many school systems around the us. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-42|Say they need more psychologists and counselors. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-43|The hopeful futures campaign report. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-44|Says most american states. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-45|Do not provide enough resources for mental health support in schools. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-46|Only idaho and the district of columbia. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-47|Go beyond the nationally-recognized ended number of one psychologist for every five hundred students. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-48|In some states including west virginia missouri texas and georgia. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-49|There is only one school psychologist for over 4,000 students. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-50|President joe biden has proposed 1 billion dollars in new federal money. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-51|To help schools hire more counselors. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-52|And psychologist. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-53|And school systems have used pandemic aid to add mental health services. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-54|Despite behavioral problems among students after returning to in-person classes. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-55|Papinka said the change has been better for the students. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-56|She said it is easier to keep students engaged in school work face-to-face. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-57|It is also easier to seek help for them when there is trouble. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-58|Douglas added that school psychologists are now trying to undo the harm that's been done during the pandemic. 
US_Schools_Pull_More-59|I'm doing over.

Ugandan-1|Businessman charles munger recently gave 200 million dollars to the university of california at santa barbara. 
Ugandan-2|Known as ucsb. 
Ugandan-3|To help pay for a new student living space. 
Ugandan-4|At colleges students living buildings called dormitories. 
Ugandan-5|Or dorms. 
Ugandan-6|For short. 
Ugandan-7|When complete the building will be called munger hall. 
Ugandan-8|The university hopes to open the dorm in late. 
Ugandan-9|2025. 
Ugandan-10|The school is in santa barbara small city. 
Ugandan-11|On the pacific coast. 
Ugandan-12|About 160 kilometres north of los angeles. 
Ugandan-13|If the plan continues based on current designs. 
Ugandan-14|It will be eleven floors high and provide beds for 4,500 students. 
Ugandan-15|On a small piece of land. 
Ugandan-16|Most of the sleeping areas for students will not have windows. 
Ugandan-17|The building only has one large entrance on each side. 
Ugandan-18|The dorm is close to the school's sports fields. 
Ugandan-19|But far from the rest of the university and the coast. 
Ugandan-20|With so many students there. 
Ugandan-21|It would be the eighth most densely populated living area in the world. 
Ugandan-22|Similar to a part of daca. 
Ugandan-23|Bangladesh. 
Ugandan-24|The building plan became publicly known recently. 
Ugandan-25|Many people were surprised by the number of students and the lack of windows. 
Ugandan-26|Said matt poldberg. 
Ugandan-27|He has already completed his studies at ucsb. 
Ugandan-28|He said. 
Ugandan-29|One of the best parts of going to school in santa barbara. 
Ugandan-30|Is closeness to the ocean. 
Ugandan-31|And beautiful areas. 
Ugandan-32|Not having windows seem strange she said. 
Ugandan-33|And being on a piece of land far away from the best parts of the school. 
Ugandan-34|What's strange 2. 
Ugandan-35|Tino's to build start of such a. 
Ugandan-36|Windowless joyless seeming place it seems like a waste and i'll have at least be like. 
Ugandan-37|You're ten steps from the beach like everything else is there. 
Ugandan-38|Munger said the design puts more importance on public spaces. 
Ugandan-39|He wants students to spend most of their time. 
Ugandan-40|Away from sleeping areas. 
Ugandan-41|So they can meet each other and work together. 
Ugandan-42|The building will have large cooking eating and gathering spaces. 
Ugandan-43|The project was not getting much attention until october. 
Ugandan-44|When one of its architects dropped out. 
Ugandan-45|Calling it. 
Ugandan-46|Disturbing. 
Ugandan-47|Dennis mcfadden wrote a letter. 
Ugandan-48|On october 24th. 
Ugandan-49|Calling the project. 
Ugandan-50|Destructive to the campus. 
Ugandan-51|And the design. 
Ugandan-52|Unsupportable. 
Ugandan-53|He said he was disappointed. 
Ugandan-54|That the group of administrators and professors. 
Ugandan-55|Studying the project. 
Ugandan-56|Did not object. 
Ugandan-57|He said the building was a radical departure from student housing standards. 
Ugandan-58|News organizations such as the new york times cnn and the guardian. 
Ugandan-59|Call wrote about mcfadden's concerns. 
Ugandan-60|Some called the project dorm zilla. 
Ugandan-61|After the japanese movie monster godzilla. 
Ugandan-62|Munger answered the criticism in early november. 
Ugandan-63|He talked with. 
Ugandan-64|Architectural record about the project. 
Ugandan-65|He said the rooms without windows are quite endurable. 
Ugandan-66|And compared them to the rooms on large vacation boats known as cruise ships. 
Ugandan-67|That do not look onto the water. 
Ugandan-68|He called the building's design safe. 
Ugandan-69|And able to meet building requirements in california. 
Ugandan-70|He said he thinks universities around the united states. 
Ugandan-71|Will build more buildings like munger hall. 
Ugandan-72|The ucsb design is similar. 
Ugandan-73|To a project. 
Ugandan-74|Munger fun did at the university of michigan. 
Ugandan-75|Students have mixed opinions about it. 
Ugandan-76|Ucsb like much of california does not have enough low-cost housing. 
Ugandan-77|There are more people who want to live in santa barbara. 
Ugandan-78|Then the number of homes available. 
Ugandan-79|That is a big problem for a university with 25,000 students. 
Ugandan-80|Add mica ir rights for the daily nexus a student newspaper at ucsb. 
Ugandan-81|She said there is a housing crisis for students. 
Ugandan-82|Some students must live far away from campus and drive. 
Ugandan-83|Over an hour to get to school. 
Ugandan-84|Others have been known to sleep in their cars. 
Ugandan-85|Right now. 
Ugandan-86|The university pays hotels. 
Ugandan-87|So students can live there. 
Ugandan-88|She said one problem. 
Ugandan-89|Is that while the university has been welcoming more students. 
Ugandan-90|It has not been building more housing. 
Ugandan-91|While the school c is munger hall is an answer. 
Ugandan-92|Ir said most students disagree. 
Ugandan-93|The general consensus among most of the people i have been. 
Ugandan-94|He proposed that a show about engineering or chemistry. 
Ugandan-95|Is that. 
Ugandan-96|This isn't a good idea. 
Ugandan-97|Ucsb however posted a question-and-answer page online recently. 
Ugandan-98|And said. 
Ugandan-99|We expect munger hall to be highly desirable. 
Ugandan-100|Nolan gray is a researcher at the university of california los angeles. 
Ugandan-101|He studies urban planning. 
Ugandan-102|He recently wrote about munger hall for bloomberg news service. 
Ugandan-103|He said. 
Ugandan-104|Let the megaderm. 
Ugandan-105|With a cost of over 1 billion dollars. 
Ugandan-106|Maybe ucsb's only way out of an extreme housing problem. 
Ugandan-107|Because the university is in california are so good grace ed. 
Ugandan-108|Schools have no trouble finding students. 
Ugandan-109|Because the cities in california are so costly to live in. 
Ugandan-110|Students often share small rooms. 
Ugandan-111|Some even have to leave school because they cannot afford to live near their classes. 
Ugandan-112|Gray called munger hall a trade-off. 
Ugandan-113|Where are students get to go to school in a beautiful place. 
Ugandan-114|In exchange for sleeping in a small windowless room. 
Ugandan-115|Living in a dorm is not unlike living in a small apartment and a really nice city. 
Ugandan-116|Right. 
Ugandan-117|When you live in a city the park is your lawn. 
Ugandan-118|The restaurants are your dining room. 
Ugandan-119|The bars are your parlor. 
Ugandan-120|The library is your office. 
Ugandan-121|Gray said he thought munger hall has a 65 or 70% chance of being built at ucsb in the coming years. 
Ugandan-122|They're probably going to do everything they can. 
Ugandan-123|To make something like this work he added. 
Ugandan-124|Irish said the responsibility for the problem rests not only with the university. 
Ugandan-125|But with the state government. 
Ugandan-126|And the communities close to the university. 
Ugandan-127|All three have not done a good job of meeting growing demand for higher education and housing. 
Ugandan-128|In addition. 
Ugandan-129|Dyer said. 
Ugandan-130|There are no other current plans for student housing. 
Ugandan-131|Youtube people putting all their eggs in one basket right monger hall is the only proposed solution that's far. 
Ugandan-132|If mangas project goes ahead it will only solve the housing problem for a short time. 
Ugandan-133|The school said it is only a partial fulfillment of our responsibility to our students. 
Ugandan-134|Kohlberg the ucsb graduate. 
Ugandan-135|Said he thinks students would still rather go to santa barbara then two other california schools.

Ukrainian_Refugees-63|That mit is not looking for students with perfect scores. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-64|But the scores are an important extra piece of information. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-65|Also smell said. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-66|Since many student took classes by video over the last two years. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-67|It was hard for teachers to give correct grades. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-68|The tests are now more valuable than the grades and some cases. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-69|Critics of standardized tests. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-70|Say wealthy students. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-71|Have an advantage and do better than poor student. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-72|Wealthy schools often have advisors who help students learn the test.

Ukrainian_Refugees-78|To see that a student is prepared for college. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-79|Even if. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-80|They have not taken the hardest science and math classes. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-81|The sat. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-82|Act.

Ukrainian_Refugees-87|A company in new york that helps students think about colleges. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-88|She is a past assistant director of admissions at mit. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-89|Blessing said the mit decision. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-90|Will not affect most students who were already planning to apply. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-91|In general she said. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-92|Students plan on taking standardized tests. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-93|And use the test optional choice. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-94|When the test scores do not turn out to be the intended. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-95|Blessing said the decision will help international students show they are comfortable. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-96|With a test in english. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-97|And an american style of evaluation. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-98|House of college and university understand just how strong and a might be in a situation where almost everyone in the applicant pool has aids. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-99|Blessing also noted that students who are thinking about going to mit. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-100|We'll also sending other scores. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-101|American students will send in advanced placement test scores.

Ukrainian_Refugees-109|If better tools become available. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-110|She told the new york times recently. 
Ukrainian_Refugees-111|I'm not saying this is the right decision for any or every other school.

University_of_California-1|The university of california-berkeley called the state's recent supreme court ruling. 
University_of_California-2|Devastating news for students who have earned a seat in the class for the upcoming school year. 
University_of_California-3|The state's highest court. 
University_of_California-4|Chose not to look at a case. 
University_of_California-5|First decided in the summer of 2021. 
University_of_California-6|That is when a lower court said. 
University_of_California-7|The university must limit the number of students on its campus. 
University_of_California-8|To about 42,000. 
University_of_California-9|For the 2020 to 2023 school year. 
University_of_California-10|Right now. 
University_of_California-11|About 45,000 students are at uc berkeley. 
University_of_California-12|Uc-berkeley is one of the top public universities in the united states. 
University_of_California-13|The school said it received over 128000 applications. 
University_of_California-14|For the upcoming freshman class. 
University_of_California-15|Border to meet the lower number. 
University_of_California-16|The university said it would bring in more students who live in california. 
University_of_California-17|As a result. 
University_of_California-18|International students and those from other american states. 
University_of_California-19|Could get fewer seats. 
University_of_California-20|In addition the university said it would ask some students to take classes from home. 
University_of_California-21|Early in the school year before coming to campus in 2023. 
University_of_California-22|Others will have to wait one year to start their college education. 
University_of_California-23|If they still want to come to berkeley. 
University_of_California-24|The university is also asking students to consider. 
University_of_California-25|Off-campus study programs. 
University_of_California-26|In sacramento. 
University_of_California-27|The state's capital. 
University_of_California-28|Or washington dc. 
University_of_California-29|The legal case was brought by a group of people who live in the city of berkeley. 
University_of_California-30|They formed an organization called save berkeley's neighborhoods or svn. 
University_of_California-31|The group said the university had not been truthful. 
University_of_California-32|About the number of students at meant to accept each year. 
University_of_California-33|It also said the school did not consider. 
University_of_California-34|How its increasing enrollment. 
University_of_California-35|What effect the surrounding neighborhoods. 
University_of_California-36|Uc-berkeley like several california schools does not have enough housing for its increasing enrollment. 
University_of_California-37|Espn said. 
University_of_California-38|The university planned in 2005. 
University_of_California-39|To increase the number of students on campus. 
University_of_California-40|Play only 1650. 
University_of_California-41|Over 15 years. 
University_of_California-42|However as of 2018. 
University_of_California-43|The number of students increased by over 8,000. 
University_of_California-44|Without enough new housing. 
University_of_California-45|The larger amount of students as being said. 
University_of_California-46|Caused an increase in noise and waste. 
University_of_California-47|Because they could not live at school. 
University_of_California-48|They moved into the neighborhoods around the school. 
University_of_California-49|Causing higher housing costs.

University_of_California-51|Spns. 
University_of_California-52|The local court to restrict the school's enrollment. 
University_of_California-53|The situation in berkeley is similar to other disputes between large california universities and their cities. 
University_of_California-54|The cities of los angeles. 
University_of_California-55|San diego and santa barbara. 
University_of_California-56|Are also dealing with increasing numbers. 
University_of_California-57|Of students. 
University_of_California-58|And universities that do not have enough housing. 
University_of_California-59|In recent years california state leaders have been working to help more students get into college. 
University_of_California-60|In 2021 they added 47 billion dollars. 
University_of_California-61|In education-related spending. 
University_of_California-62|To increase the number of students going to public colleges. 
University_of_California-63|Groups like espeon. 
University_of_California-64|Say the state has not required universities. 
University_of_California-65|To build more housing. 
University_of_California-66|While it has been pushing them to accept more students. 
University_of_California-67|On the other side universities like uc berkeley. 
University_of_California-68|Say environmental restrictions in california. 
University_of_California-69|Make it difficult for them to build new housing for students. 
University_of_California-70|Save berkeley's neighborhoods argued that uc berkeley's failure to limit the number of students violates a state environmental law. 
University_of_California-71|Put in place in 1970. 
University_of_California-72|And the school said. 
University_of_California-73|Lengthy environmental reviews for new buildings. 
University_of_California-74|Have limited its attempts to build more housing for students. 
University_of_California-75|State lawmaker scott wiener. 
University_of_California-76|Said he would find a way to permit colleges. 
University_of_California-77|To build student housing more easily. 
University_of_California-78|When the california supreme court. 
University_of_California-79|Said it would not review the lower court's decision. 
University_of_California-80|Espn offered to work with uc berkeley. 
University_of_California-81|To prevent 1,000 more students for the upcoming school year. 
University_of_California-82|If most of them were from california. 
University_of_California-83|The university declined the offer. 
University_of_California-84|A spokesperson told the local newspaper that decisions on the number of students. 
University_of_California-85|Are made by elected officials and school leaders. 
University_of_California-86|And not by a small group. 
University_of_California-87|The university also plans to appeal the decision later this year. 
University_of_California-88|Jesse lives he recently completed his advanced studies in physics at uc berkeley. 
University_of_California-89|He said he does not believe there is a serious conflict. 
University_of_California-90|Between the university and the city. 
University_of_California-91|Everyone is concerned about the high cost of housing in northern california. 
University_of_California-92|It's a big problem in the bay area that goes way beyond. 
University_of_California-94|I don't feel like we've had some like breaking point or. 
University_of_California-95|Something is now unsustainable. 
University_of_California-96|Livesey said that rejecting qualified students is not a way to solve the housing problem. 
University_of_California-97|I would love for those students to be able to come to berkeley and i think that's what should happen.

Unsung_Heroes-1|The theatrical magic that keeps new york's broadway going during the latest covid-19 spread. 
Unsung_Heroes-2|Has been performers. 
Unsung_Heroes-3|Ready to step in in an emergency. 
Unsung_Heroes-4|Actor carlos tickler went a step further. 
Unsung_Heroes-5|She returned to acting from retirement. 
Unsung_Heroes-6|To save the musical wicked. 
Unsung_Heroes-7|Stickler launched a new career as a software engineer in chicago 3 years ago. 
Unsung_Heroes-8|But she canceled her vacation this winter. 
Unsung_Heroes-9|And went to new york city's center of theater performances. 
Unsung_Heroes-10|Broadway. 
Unsung_Heroes-11|She had agreed to replace a star of the show after much of the cast. 
Unsung_Heroes-12|Became infected with covid-19. 
Unsung_Heroes-13|Stickler played the green-skinned alphabet. 
Unsung_Heroes-14|In the musical play. 
Unsung_Heroes-15|She may have been playing an evil witch. 
Unsung_Heroes-16|But sticklers effort was all good. 
Unsung_Heroes-17|It was like riding a bike she said. 
Unsung_Heroes-18|I got out there and i was like oh i remember this. 
Unsung_Heroes-19|This is really special. 
Unsung_Heroes-20|And i'm just going to try to enjoy. 
Unsung_Heroes-21|Every second of it. 
Unsung_Heroes-22|Her effort is just one example of the work broadway's understudies do. 
Unsung_Heroes-23|They are standbys and fill-ins. 
Unsung_Heroes-24|Who keeps shows open. 
Unsung_Heroes-25|Often they learn several parts. 
Unsung_Heroes-26|With little official rehearsing. 
Unsung_Heroes-27|The heavy pressure on theater companies to keep shows open is eased by these skillful performers. 
Unsung_Heroes-28|Actor hugh jackman recently praised the many understudies who kept his revival of the music man open. 
Unsung_Heroes-29|Stickler said the recognition of these less famous performers is important. 
Unsung_Heroes-30|I think they sometimes get overlooked. 
Unsung_Heroes-31|Seaside. 
Unsung_Heroes-32|Adding. 
Unsung_Heroes-33|It's been really emotional to see the outpouring of love. 
Unsung_Heroes-34|For all what they do. 
Unsung_Heroes-35|Stickler was not alone in trying to rescue broadway. 
Unsung_Heroes-36|At one point over the holidays. 
Unsung_Heroes-37|Eight of the 12 actors in broadway's come from away we're substitutes. 
Unsung_Heroes-38|Included two. 
Unsung_Heroes-39|Pearl sun and holly and butler. 
Unsung_Heroes-40|Who had left the production. 
Unsung_Heroes-41|Another marika aubrey returned to broadway from the traveling show. 
Unsung_Heroes-42|Josh breckenridge is the musical's dance captain. 
Unsung_Heroes-43|He is also a standby performer for five of the six males in the play. 
Unsung_Heroes-44|It really took a village and it was a beautiful village breckenridge said. 
Unsung_Heroes-45|I'm very proud of us for nailing it. 
Unsung_Heroes-46|He also praised the crowds who watched the show. 
Unsung_Heroes-47|Describing the support as wonderful. 
Unsung_Heroes-48|Breckenridge has been on broadway with the scottsboro boys. 
Unsung_Heroes-49|The reds. 
Unsung_Heroes-50|And other shows. 
Unsung_Heroes-51|He helps me theater system will learn from recent experiences. 
Unsung_Heroes-52|And make changes to better meet difficult times. 
Unsung_Heroes-53|He called on the industry to employ more standbys and fill-ins. 
Unsung_Heroes-54|I hope that producers out there notice and start to hire more coverage. 
Unsung_Heroes-55|So that we can avoid moments like this. 
Unsung_Heroes-56|He said. 
Unsung_Heroes-57|Breckenridge added. 
Unsung_Heroes-58|We're literally the reason for the phrase the show must go on. 
Unsung_Heroes-59|Stickler was one reason wicked to continue this holiday season. 
Unsung_Heroes-60|On december 27th she was driving with her husband and dog to maine. 
Unsung_Heroes-61|For a one-week vacation with friends. 
Unsung_Heroes-62|She got an urgent call from the producers. 
Unsung_Heroes-63|To return to the musical. 
Unsung_Heroes-64|Stickler had last performed the part on broadway in 2015. 
Unsung_Heroes-65|She had spent ten years with the broadway company and starred in a national series of wicked. 
Unsung_Heroes-66|Alphabet is just kind of something that lives in my body. 
Unsung_Heroes-67|And i think a lot of other understudies will say the same thing. 
Unsung_Heroes-68|She said. 
Unsung_Heroes-69|I think everybody is really doing the best i can she said. 
Unsung_Heroes-70|I do think the fact that the show has been able to stay open is a testament to how devoted the actors are to the show. 
Unsung_Heroes-71|And how great and talented the group of people that they have hired over the years are. 
Unsung_Heroes-72|Well actors and crews working on broadway are all vaccinated. 
Unsung_Heroes-73|Wear masks. 
Unsung_Heroes-74|And get tested daily. 
Unsung_Heroes-75|Infections have spread anyway. 
Unsung_Heroes-76|Several productions including aladdin. 
Unsung_Heroes-77|Hamilton dear evan hansen. 
Unsung_Heroes-78|The lion king + 6. 
Unsung_Heroes-79|Suspended performances because of infected performers. 
Unsung_Heroes-80|Stickler is staying in new york this week just in case wicked needs her help. 
Unsung_Heroes-81|Then she will travel back to chicago. 
Unsung_Heroes-82|But she would not likely refuse a similar call to act. 
Unsung_Heroes-83|In the future. 
Unsung_Heroes-84|I would do it again in a heartbeat. 
Unsung_Heroes-85|I love the show she said. 
Unsung_Heroes-86|If i turn 100 i'll do it at my 100th birthday party. 
Unsung_Heroes-87|I'm katy weaver.

Ways_to_Grow-1|From voa learning english. 
Ways_to_Grow-2|This is the health and lifestyle report. 
Ways_to_Grow-3|If you want your children to become ready willing and able gardeners. 
Ways_to_Grow-4|Take steps early. 
Ways_to_Grow-5|It is not difficult. 
Ways_to_Grow-6|But you might need to change your thinking about children in the garden. 
Ways_to_Grow-7|That is one of the many suggestions made by jeff lowenfels. 
Ways_to_Grow-8|He writes about gardening for the associated press. 
Ways_to_Grow-9|Lowenfels says. 
Ways_to_Grow-10|That gardeners are made. 
Ways_to_Grow-11|Not born. 
Ways_to_Grow-12|He suggests several ways to help turn a child into a gardener. 
Ways_to_Grow-13|The first step is to get your child interested in plants. 
Ways_to_Grow-14|This he says is getting more difficult. 
Ways_to_Grow-15|Because of competition from electronics. 
Ways_to_Grow-16|Taking a child to a plant store is another good place to start. 
Ways_to_Grow-17|There they can smell the flowers and touch other plants. 
Ways_to_Grow-18|Next. 
Ways_to_Grow-19|Let your child by a plant. 
Ways_to_Grow-20|Lowenfeld says he still remembers the first plant his father helped him choose when he was six years old. 
Ways_to_Grow-21|He says that plans. 
Ways_to_Grow-22|Called a lantana. 
Ways_to_Grow-23|Is where his love of plants and gardening began to grow. 
Ways_to_Grow-24|Children not old enough to care for a plant by themselves need adults to teach them. 
Ways_to_Grow-25|This may be the best way to get children interested in gardening. 
Ways_to_Grow-26|Children copy adults. 
Ways_to_Grow-27|So let them see how much you enjoy working with plants. 
Ways_to_Grow-28|Another great way to lead young people into gardening is to have them grow plants from seeds. 
Ways_to_Grow-29|This is very effective when the plants are things they like to eat. 
Ways_to_Grow-30|Carrots are favorites of many children. 
Ways_to_Grow-31|Lowenfels suggest. 
Ways_to_Grow-32|Starting with larger seeds. 
Ways_to_Grow-33|Handling very small seeds may frustrate small children. 
Ways_to_Grow-34|He says there are plenty of seeds big enough for little fingers to pick up and plant. 
Ways_to_Grow-35|He suggests marigolds. 
Ways_to_Grow-36|Cosmos. 
Ways_to_Grow-37|Zinnias. 
Ways_to_Grow-38|Sunflowers. 
Ways_to_Grow-39|Corn. 
Ways_to_Grow-40|Peas and beans. 
Ways_to_Grow-41|They are also easy to start in containers. 
Ways_to_Grow-42|As well as directly into the gardens soil. 
Ways_to_Grow-43|Don't forget. 
Ways_to_Grow-44|That children like responsibility. 
Ways_to_Grow-45|Find a gardening tasks that fits their age. 
Ways_to_Grow-46|And is just for them. 
Ways_to_Grow-47|They can fill containers with soil. 
Ways_to_Grow-48|You can show them how to water. 
Ways_to_Grow-49|And how to place labels. 
Ways_to_Grow-50|You can also show them how to provide the right amount of light. 
Ways_to_Grow-51|Small children can help in other ways. 
Ways_to_Grow-52|Lowenfels says his first garden job at age 5. 
Ways_to_Grow-53|Was deadheading dandelion flowers into a container. 
Ways_to_Grow-54|To deadhead means to take dead flowers off a plant. 
Ways_to_Grow-55|When his own children wanted to be in the garden he gave them the job of hunting worms. 
Ways_to_Grow-56|Then they moved on to deadheading dandelions and pulling weeds. 
Ways_to_Grow-57|Most important however is to have the proper attitude as head gardener and teacher. 
Ways_to_Grow-58|Any adult teaching a child about gardening he says. 
Ways_to_Grow-59|Needs an easygoing go-with-the-flow attitude. 
Ways_to_Grow-60|It's not. 
Ways_to_Grow-61|They could put a child off gardening forever. 
Ways_to_Grow-62|Learning is about making mistakes. 
Ways_to_Grow-63|And with gardening that means stepping on plants. 
Ways_to_Grow-64|And accidentally pulling things that are not weeds. 
Ways_to_Grow-65|Lowenfels shares a story of his own daughter. 
Ways_to_Grow-66|At the time she was 4 years old. 
Ways_to_Grow-67|And was helping him prepare their flower garden. 
Ways_to_Grow-68|For a flower show the next day. 
Ways_to_Grow-69|Unbeknownst. 
Ways_to_Grow-70|She was following behind him and cleaning up. 
Ways_to_Grow-71|Which to herman's removing all the flowers. 
Ways_to_Grow-72|Instead of getting angry he simply put the flowers into containers. 
Ways_to_Grow-73|And suck them near the bear plant. 
Ways_to_Grow-74|Because of a little attitude adjustment on my part he writes. 
Ways_to_Grow-75|40 years later my daughter still loves to garden. 
Ways_to_Grow-76|And she is pretty good at floral arranging to. 
Ways_to_Grow-77|And that's the health and lifestyle report. 
Ways_to_Grow-78|I'm on a mateo. 
When_Planning_Spring-1|As winter comes to an end. 
When_Planning_Spring-2|Gardeners in northern parts of the world. 
When_Planning_Spring-3|Look for signs of life. 
When_Planning_Spring-4|They look for plants that are growing from roots that were planted in autumn. 
When_Planning_Spring-5|Many gardeners are looking for the return of leaves too many of their trees. 
When_Planning_Spring-6|By planning. 
When_Planning_Spring-7|People can grow plants that keep their gardens interesting to look at. 
When_Planning_Spring-8|Even during cold.. 
When_Planning_Spring-9|Here are some suggestions. 
When_Planning_Spring-10|For planning an interesting winter garden. 
When_Planning_Spring-11|First. 
When_Planning_Spring-12|Create a wall in the back of the garden. 
When_Planning_Spring-13|With plants that keep leaves throughout the year. 
When_Planning_Spring-14|That way. 
When_Planning_Spring-15|When some plants lose their leaves. 
When_Planning_Spring-16|The guardian will still have structure. 
When_Planning_Spring-17|That provides privacy and interest for the eye. 
When_Planning_Spring-18|Next. 
When_Planning_Spring-19|Consider how the garden looks from the street. 
When_Planning_Spring-20|It matters how others see the garden. 
When_Planning_Spring-21|But the person who sees that the most is the gardener. 
When_Planning_Spring-22|And those who live in the house. 
When_Planning_Spring-23|Gardeners should consider where they spend most of their time. 
When_Planning_Spring-24|Do they spend a lot of time looking at one part of the garden. 
When_Planning_Spring-25|They should study how the garden looks from indoors. 
When_Planning_Spring-26|When choosing plants. 
When_Planning_Spring-27|Consider how all parts of the plant. 
When_Planning_Spring-28|From the fruit to the bark. 
When_Planning_Spring-29|Well improve the guardians appearance. 
When_Planning_Spring-30|Some plants that are interesting to see in the winter. 
When_Planning_Spring-31|Do not look very good during the summer. 
When_Planning_Spring-32|The red twig dogwood. 
When_Planning_Spring-33|Also known as the cornus alba. 
When_Planning_Spring-34|Will leave upright red leafless bush in the winter. 
When_Planning_Spring-35|Another bush that is beautiful in the winter. 
When_Planning_Spring-36|Is the american beautyberry. 
When_Planning_Spring-37|Also called callicarpa americana. 
When_Planning_Spring-38|It is from the southeast united states. 
When_Planning_Spring-39|And leaves small bright purple fruit. 
When_Planning_Spring-40|Or berries. 
When_Planning_Spring-41|That hang on all winter. 
When_Planning_Spring-42|Or until the birds eat then. 
When_Planning_Spring-43|Winterberry holly is another bush from north america. 
When_Planning_Spring-44|It has bright red berries in the winter. 
When_Planning_Spring-45|That are just as pleasing for the eyes. 
When_Planning_Spring-46|As they are for the birds. 
When_Planning_Spring-47|Plant one male for every 628 female plants. 
When_Planning_Spring-48|To make sure they produce fruit. 
When_Planning_Spring-49|Trees with beautiful bark can draw people in as well. 
When_Planning_Spring-50|The bark of the paperback maple. 
When_Planning_Spring-51|Teal's back to a rich red bark underneath. 
When_Planning_Spring-52|Another tree. 
When_Planning_Spring-53|The paperbirch provides four seasons of interest. 
When_Planning_Spring-54|It has beautiful leaves in the fall. 
When_Planning_Spring-55|And beautiful bark that begins to peel when the tree is about 3 years old. 
When_Planning_Spring-56|Plants are not the only interesting thing in the winter garden. 
When_Planning_Spring-57|Think about wildlife. 
When_Planning_Spring-58|A bird feeder that can be seen from inside the home. 
When_Planning_Spring-59|Can have a calming effect on everyone. 
When_Planning_Spring-60|Play sit outside the children's bedroom windows. 
When_Planning_Spring-61|And the children will enjoy its calming effect. 
When_Planning_Spring-62|Without even knowing it. 
When_Planning_Spring-63|Gracias like little bluestem. 
When_Planning_Spring-64|Fountain grass and sea oats. 
When_Planning_Spring-65|Can't be left standing until spring. 
When_Planning_Spring-66|They provide a shelter for wildlife and insects over the winter. 
When_Planning_Spring-67|They also are a beautiful sight for the borders of gardens. 
When_Planning_Spring-68|And their seeds provide food for hungry birds. 
When_Planning_Spring-69|However. 
When_Planning_Spring-70|There are some plants that gardeners should clear away in fall. 
When_Planning_Spring-71|The hosta plant is a favorite home in the winter for a damaging garden creature. 
When_Planning_Spring-72|The slug. 
When_Planning_Spring-73|The plants should be cut back when the colors become lighter. 
When_Planning_Spring-74|Another plant. 
When_Planning_Spring-75|The iris. 
When_Planning_Spring-76|Should be cut back because it can shelter harmful insect eggs. 
When_Planning_Spring-77|Plants that showed signs of disease during the past growing season. 
When_Planning_Spring-78|Should be removed before winter. 
When_Planning_Spring-79|Additionally. 
When_Planning_Spring-80|Some flowering plants that come back each year. 
When_Planning_Spring-81|Should be cut back to prevent disease. 
When_Planning_Spring-82|They include the bee balm. 
When_Planning_Spring-83|Pme. 
When_Planning_Spring-84|And flocks. 
When_Planning_Spring-85|I'm gregory stoeckel. 
Who-1|A recent study found that americans who completed college or university. 
Who-2|Are more likely to have friends. 
Who-3|And are less lonely than those who only finished high school. 
Who-4|The findings come at a time when many americans question whether a college degree is worth its cost. 
Who-5|Daniel cox is director of the survey center on american life. 
Who-6|And a senior fellow at the american enterprise institute. 
Who-7|He said that in general. 
Who-8|Americans are experiencing a friend recession. 
Who-9|Meaning of decline in their number of friends. 
Who-10|Cox noted that americans have fewer close friends today than we did in the early 90s. 
Who-11|But some groups were particularly affected. 
Who-12|In that they seem to have experienced a much more dramatic decline over that time.. 
Who-13|He added. 
Who-14|If there are two groups that really stood out. 
Who-15|The first is men. 
Who-16|And the second one is people without a college degree. 
Who-17|The survey center on american life. 
Who-18|Questioned 5054 people this past summer. 
Who-19|It found that americans with a college degree. 
Who-20|Feel more socially connected. 
Who-21|And are more active in their communities. 
Who-22|10 people who did not go to college. 
Who-23|As a result. 
Who-24|Those who completed college report feeling less lonely. 
Who-25|Cox believes that the issue is a result of the decline in traditional institutions. 
Who-26|Meaning religion. 
Who-27|Marriage. 
Who-28|And unions. 
Who-29|Unions were primarily financial. 
Who-30|But they also offered a lot of social support and social connection and feelings of belonging as well. 
Who-31|The decline of unions the decline of marriage. 
Who-32|And the decline of religion. 
Who-33|Have all disproportionately affected the non-college group. 
Who-34|Disproportionately in this case. 
Who-35|Means too large in relation to something. 
Who-36|Previous research shows that americans who did not go to college are less likely to marry. 
Who-37|A 2013 study of people born between 1957 and 1964. 
Who-38|Found that both men and women who did not finish high school. 
Who-39|We're less likely to marry than those with more education. 
Who-40|A 2012 study found that college-educated women were much more likely to get married. 
Who-41|Then women who dropped out does high school. 
Who-42|Cox points to research that shows that people who are married are more likely to have a larger social group. 
Who-43|And more close friends and reports feeling lonely less often. 
Who-44|Today 65% of college-educated americans over age 25 are married. 
Who-45|But 50% of people with a high school diploma. 
Who-46|Or who dropped out of high school are married. 
Who-47|Those numbers were different than 1990. 
Who-48|When marriage rates among the college-educated we're at 69%. 
Who-49|Compared with 63%. 
Who-50|For those who did not go to college. 
Who-51|Says a few research report. 
Who-52|You also finds that americans are less religious overall. 
Who-53|The percentage of americans who say they are religiously unaffiliated. 
Who-54|Rose from 17% in 2009. 
Who-55|To 26% in 2018 and 2019. 
Who-56|When it comes to unions. 
Who-57|The percentage of workers who belong to a union has declined by almost half. 
Who-58|Since 1983. 
Who-59|When 20% of us workers were union members. 
Who-60|Union membership had drop to 10.8% by 2020. 
Who-61|The american community life survey found that around one in 10 college graduates. 
Who-62|Say they have no clothes social connections. 
Who-63|That number rises among americans without a degree. 
Who-64|We're almost one in four say they have no close friends.

Winter_Break-1|In the united states debates over issues like reopening masks vaccines and racism. 
Winter_Break-2|Played out all over the country in 2021. 
Winter_Break-3|And it was no different for schools. 
Winter_Break-4|That's vaccines started being distributed to teachers and school officials in january. 
Winter_Break-5|Americans were hopeful schools could start returning to normal. 
Winter_Break-6|The pandemic forced many school systems to give up in-person classes in 2020. 
Winter_Break-7|Many american students were still learning remotely as 2021 began. 
Winter_Break-8|Research from last year showed how students learning slowed. 
Winter_Break-9|Largely due to the change to online learning. 
Winter_Break-10|In the winter and spring schools slowly started bringing students back in person. 
Winter_Break-11|And as the new school year began in the autumn it appeared that schools were ready for a return to full-time in-person classes. 
Winter_Break-12|But officials politicians families and students. 
Winter_Break-13|Could not seem to agree on how to safely return to class. 
Winter_Break-14|The highly infectious delta variance of the coronavirus. 
Winter_Break-15|Started spreading in the us. 
Winter_Break-16|Just before the new school year. 
Winter_Break-17|And plans quickly changed. 
Winter_Break-18|The centers for disease control and prevention issued guidance in august. 
Winter_Break-19|Recommending that all students teachers and school workers. 
Winter_Break-20|Wear masks in schools. 
Winter_Break-21|But some state lawmakers policies on masking went against school and public health officials opinions. 
Winter_Break-22|On what was it. 
Winter_Break-23|Florida governor ron desantis band schools in the state from requiring masks. 
Winter_Break-24|He called mask-wearing a choice that parents should make. 
Winter_Break-25|And not the government. 
Winter_Break-26|He also claimed that masks prevented children from learning and communicating. 
Winter_Break-27|But some school systems in the state. 
Winter_Break-28|Chose not to listen to the governor's order. 
Winter_Break-29|When was leon county. 
Winter_Break-30|Where the state capitol of tallahassee is located. 
Winter_Break-31|Sara lee is a mother of two children attending school in leon county. 
Winter_Break-32|She said wearing masks did not prevent her kids from learning. 
Winter_Break-33|As desantis has suggested. 
Winter_Break-34|I was relieved when our school board went against our governor. 
Winter_Break-35|Miitopia. 
Winter_Break-36|The state of texas also bend masks. 
Winter_Break-37|Schools in the cities of austin and dallas. 
Winter_Break-38|Choose to ignore the band. 
Winter_Break-39|Has vaccines for children became available in april and may. 
Winter_Break-40|Schools made efforts to get them shots. 
Winter_Break-41|Public health experts say. 
Winter_Break-42|Vaccines are the most effective way. 
Winter_Break-43|To prevent severe illness from covid-19. 
Winter_Break-44|But there continues to be plenty of misinformation on the vaccine safety. 
Winter_Break-45|And effectiveness. 
Winter_Break-46|And some lawmakers have tried to prevent schools. 
Winter_Break-47|I'm vaccinating students. 
Winter_Break-48|In tennessee. 
Winter_Break-49|The health department. 
Winter_Break-50|Ended vaccination events aimed at children. 
Winter_Break-51|Republican lawmakers accused the health department. 
Winter_Break-52|Of pressuring children to get the vaccine. 
Winter_Break-53|Children are at lower risk. 
Winter_Break-54|Of getting severe covid-19 infection. 
Winter_Break-55|And being hospitalized. 
Winter_Break-56|However. 
Winter_Break-57|The risk remains. 
Winter_Break-58|They can also still spread the disease to school workers and family members. 
Winter_Break-59|Like in many areas of the economy the pandemic has led to teacher and worker shortages in schools. 
Winter_Break-60|Teachers have been retiring. 
Winter_Break-61|Or leaving their jobs at high rates. 
Winter_Break-62|Many have experienced burnout. 
Winter_Break-63|Districts of face shortages before. 
Winter_Break-64|Many now see it is the worst it has ever been. 
Winter_Break-65|The national education association. 
Winter_Break-66|Question 2690 educators in june. 
Winter_Break-67|32% said the pandemic drove them to leave teaching earlier than expected. 
Winter_Break-68|Another survey by the rand corporation. 
Winter_Break-69|Found the teachers had high levels of stress. 
Winter_Break-70|And or three times more likely. 
Winter_Break-71|In adults in other professions. 
Winter_Break-72|To experience depression. 
Winter_Break-73|This is the worst shortage of labour we have ever had. 
Winter_Break-74|Tony wald. 
Winter_Break-75|He is the superintendent of a school system. 
Winter_Break-76|In california's. 
Winter_Break-77|West contra costa county. 
Winter_Break-78|We opened this year with 50 teaching positions open. 
Winter_Break-79|That means students are going to 50 classrooms. 
Winter_Break-80|But do not have a permanent teacher. 
Winter_Break-81|There is also a shortage of cleaners. 
Winter_Break-82|Food service workers and others will said. 
Winter_Break-83|Schools parents and lawmakers also disagreed over ways to teach about racism and critical race theory. 
Winter_Break-84|Crt. 
Winter_Break-85|In schools. 
Winter_Break-86|Critical race theory is a way of thinking about america's history through race. 
Winter_Break-87|It argues that racism is a part of all of america's governments and businesses. 
Winter_Break-88|And more than just individual discrimination. 
Winter_Break-89|Some ideas related to the theory are being taught in public schools. 
Winter_Break-90|Tessie's honor teaches american history in montgomery county maryland. 
Winter_Break-91|She said it would be very hard to teach her class. 
Winter_Break-92|Without using some crt ideas. 
Winter_Break-93|Play america's history of racism. 
Winter_Break-94|In order to teach a u.s. history class correctly. 
Winter_Break-95|You have to talk about those things she said. 
Winter_Break-96|You can't prepare students if you're not teaching the truth about u.s. history. 
Winter_Break-97|Teaching race in schools has become an important cause for conservatives. 
Winter_Break-98|Many republican-controlled states have passed legislation. 
Winter_Break-99|Restricting how history and race can be taught in public school. 
Winter_Break-100|The issue of critical race theory helps virginia republican glen younkin. 
Winter_Break-101|Win the election for governor. 
Winter_Break-102|He argued that crt amounted to a kind of reverse racism. 
Winter_Break-103|That taught white students to feel guilty about the nation's history. 
Winter_Break-104|I do is a high school students in chicago. 
Winter_Break-105|Her class learned about the new york times 1619 project. 
Winter_Break-106|The well-known and controversial project released in 2019. 
Winter_Break-107|Is about slavery's effects on modern-day america. 
Winter_Break-108|She told voa she sees a connection between states trying to control. 
Winter_Break-109|How to teach racism. 
Winter_Break-110|And george floyd's murder and the nationwide protests for racial equality. 
Winter_Break-111|They don't want us to know the effects of slavery or still going on. 
Winter_Break-112|I do said. 
Winter_Break-113|When george floyd was killed. 
Winter_Break-114|That kind of showed that even though slavery is over. 
Winter_Break-115|This is the remnants of it. 
Winter_Break-116|The quick spread of the omicron variant of the pandemic. 
Winter_Break-117|Threatens schools ability to stay open. 
Winter_Break-118|Mini school systems around the country. 
Winter_Break-119|Changed to fully online classes. 
Winter_Break-120|Ahead of the holiday break. 
Winter_Break-121|New york city has the country's largest school system. 
Winter_Break-122|On december 20th. 
Winter_Break-123|One-fifth of the city's students did not attend class. 
Winter_Break-124|Likely out of concern about the virus. 
Winter_Break-125|New york governor kathy hochul. 
Winter_Break-126|Promised to keep schools open. 
Winter_Break-127|She said last week. 
Winter_Break-128|We believe that it's critically important. 
Winter_Break-129|That are children not end up in that same situation they were. 
Winter_Break-130|For so many months. 
Winter_Break-131|When they were so displaced from their normal environment.

Woodworking_Skills-1|Handing power tools over to young students. 
Woodworking_Skills-2|Could result in some disastrous situations. 
Woodworking_Skills-3|But if those tools are combined with effective supervision and teaching. 
Woodworking_Skills-4|The students can learn valuable new skills. 
Woodworking_Skills-5|And might even find a new career path. 
Woodworking_Skills-6|One such program in washington dc. 
Woodworking_Skills-7|Aims to teach woodworking and finished carpentry skills. 
Woodworking_Skills-8|Two teens and young adults. 
Woodworking_Skills-9|It includes a woodshop completely housed inside a truck. 
Woodworking_Skills-10|That acts as a kind of classroom on wheels. 
Woodworking_Skills-11|The mobile woodshop program. 
Woodworking_Skills-12|Was started by the nonprofit zenith community arts foundation. 
Woodworking_Skills-13|It is currently based at ballou stay opportunity academy in washington dc. 
Woodworking_Skills-14|Ballou stay is an alternative education program. 
Woodworking_Skills-15|It offers students job training. 
Woodworking_Skills-16|It has a high school graduation program. 
Woodworking_Skills-17|For adults over age 23. 
Woodworking_Skills-18|Margery goldberg zenith director said the goal of the woodshop is to get people jobs. 
Woodworking_Skills-19|Goldberg is an artist wood sculptor. 
Woodworking_Skills-20|And longtime member of the dc art community. 
Woodworking_Skills-21|She had long dreamed of creating a mobile woodshop to assist students. 
Woodworking_Skills-22|That's dream finally came true in 2020. 
Woodworking_Skills-23|When the city gave her a large grant for the program. 
Woodworking_Skills-24|The program at ballou is called a pre-apprenticeship carpentry training program. 
Woodworking_Skills-25|The subjects and skills taught in the class. 
Woodworking_Skills-26|Are similar to those offered by a local carpenter's union. 
Woodworking_Skills-27|It also supports the program. 
Woodworking_Skills-28|Students at blue can learn the same skills as a beginning carpenter wood. 
Woodworking_Skills-29|These include cutting marking. 
Woodworking_Skills-30|Measuring. 
Woodworking_Skills-31|Namely. 
Woodworking_Skills-32|And how to use different tools. 
Woodworking_Skills-33|The class textbook provides step-by-step instructions. 
Woodworking_Skills-34|On how to make things like simple wooden birdhouses. 
Woodworking_Skills-35|Two more complex wooden containers and objects. 
Woodworking_Skills-36|The truck is equipped with all the instructional materials. 
Woodworking_Skills-37|And tools necessary to operate as a complete mobile classroom. 
Woodworking_Skills-38|Mobile workstations are also available. 
Woodworking_Skills-39|So students can work on projects outside the truck. 
Woodworking_Skills-40|If students passed the class they can seek to enter the union apprenticeship program. 
Woodworking_Skills-41|Instead of a usual four-year apprenticeship. 
Woodworking_Skills-42|Graduates of the mobile woodshop can finish in less time. 
Woodworking_Skills-43|Joe largest is a teacher at the woodshop. 
Woodworking_Skills-44|He said much of the class centers on teaching students soft skills. 
Woodworking_Skills-45|These are skills that are desirable in all jobs. 
Woodworking_Skills-46|Such as teamwork. 
Woodworking_Skills-47|Having a strong work ethic. 
Woodworking_Skills-48|Being able to follow instructions. 
Woodworking_Skills-49|And arriving to work on time. 
Woodworking_Skills-50|Students also learn basic skills like math and how to read a ruler. 
Woodworking_Skills-51|The union wants people who are employment ready said austin-travis the woodshops of their teacher. 
Woodworking_Skills-52|And that's a lot more soft skills than just being able to put all that stuff together he added. 
Woodworking_Skills-53|Ryan is a student at the mobile woodshop. 
Woodworking_Skills-54|Before entering the class he had some experience working with wooden tools. 
Woodworking_Skills-55|You got even help a family member build a fence around a house. 
Woodworking_Skills-56|That's why i started in the class. 
Woodworking_Skills-57|Because i like working with my hands. 
Woodworking_Skills-58|And i already knew how to work with electrical tools. 
Woodworking_Skills-59|Ryan said. 
Woodworking_Skills-60|I wanted to give myself a chance to get better at it. 
Woodworking_Skills-61|Brian said he sees another benefits to learning woodworking. 
Woodworking_Skills-62|You can sell some of the stuff and make money for it. 
Woodworking_Skills-63|Building-related jobs are currently in high demand across the united states. 
Woodworking_Skills-64|One study from the home builders institute. 
Woodworking_Skills-65|Found that 2.2 million jobs will be needed by 2024. 
Woodworking_Skills-66|To keep up with building demand. 
Woodworking_Skills-67|And the us bureau for labor statistics. 
Woodworking_Skills-68|Estimates that more than 89,000 openings for carpenters. 
Woodworking_Skills-69|Will be created each year in the us over the next 10 years. 
Woodworking_Skills-70|Goldberg believes woodshop programs can help prepare the next generation of woodworkers. 
Woodworking_Skills-71|She said other schools in washington have expressed interest in the mobile woodshop. 
Woodworking_Skills-72|And the program might be expanded in the coming years. 
Woodworking_Skills-73|Largest said the class at falu. 
Woodworking_Skills-74|Seeks to help some people who wouldn't have the chance to even get into the apprenticeship program. 
Woodworking_Skills-75|And give them a leg up. 
Woodworking_Skills-76|That he added can hopefully help them with a better future. 
Woodworking_Skills-77|I'm dan novak. 
Workers-1|On an afternoon in early september carnegie mellon university was busy with students. 
Workers-2|Even though it was raining outside. 
Workers-3|The grounds of the school on forbes avenue in pittsburgh pennsylvania. 
Workers-4|We different. 
Workers-5|Then they were in september 2020. 
Workers-6|Last year. 
Workers-7|The university was empty. 
Workers-8|After covid-19 restrictions. 
Workers-9|Kept most students home. 
Workers-10|After a year with many students working from home. 
Workers-11|Places to eat and study were once again filled with people. 
Workers-12|All wearing face coverings indoors. 
Workers-13|Last september zach manchester was in his first year as an assistant professor. 
Workers-14|At the school's robotics institute. 
Workers-15|Carnegie mellon is known for its science and technology programs. 
Workers-16|Manchester came to pennsylvania. 
Workers-17|From stanford university in california. 
Workers-18|Where he taught aeronautics. 
Workers-19|Or flight science. 
Workers-20|Manchester communicated through video links. 
Workers-21|Throughout the 2020 2021 school year. 
Workers-22|With one of his. 
Workers-23|Former stanford students. 
Workers-24|They worked on a project. 
Workers-25|That developed a series of small satellites. 
Workers-26|Known as. 
Workers-27|Cubesats. 
Workers-28|The satellites each weigh about 1 kg. 
Workers-29|Manchester watched as maxx holiday built the cubesats in his kitchen in california. 
Workers-30|Manchester said holiday was doing. 
Workers-31|Pretty heroic insane things. 
Workers-32|With trying to get the satellite stuff to fly. 
Workers-33|The three-person team got the satellites ready so they could be included. 
Workers-34|Anna spacex rocket. 
Workers-35|That launched from cape canaveral in florida. 
Workers-36|On january 24th. 
Workers-37|2021. 
Workers-38|Once in orbit. 
Workers-39|The satellites work together as a group to do things like take photos and communicate using radio signals. 
Workers-40|Given the circumstances. 
Workers-41|We did a pretty good job of getting the work done manchester said. 
Workers-42|Now manchester looks back on that time. 
Workers-43|Could the satellite project have gone better with more in-person testing. 
Workers-44|Yes. 
Workers-45|Did it work out well enough. 
Workers-46|Yes. 
Workers-47|We do some satellites and got him into space. 
Workers-48|With like a three-person team with one person doing almost all the hardware work. 
Workers-49|Front of kitchen all things considered i think we pulled off something. 
Workers-50|It's pretty impressive that we got it to happen. 
Workers-51|Now that he and his new students are working together in pittsburgh. 
Workers-52|The first goal is to catch up on real-world work. 
Workers-53|Manchester and his students spent most of 2021. 
Workers-54|Writing computer instructions. 
Workers-55|And making computer-based predictions. 
Workers-56|Of how robots and drones move. 
Workers-57|These are called computer simulations. 
Workers-58|Now they have to find out if their predictions were correct. 
Workers-59|By testing them with real robots in the laboratory. 
Workers-60|Manchester said he is never surprised. 
Workers-61|When robots faceplant. 
Workers-62|Or crash. 
Workers-63|The first time out. 
Workers-64|Message this is known in the in the field has the same to real.. 
Workers-65|Simulators are cool but they don't really reflect reality. 
Workers-66|Ever and that is always. 
Workers-67|Little extra dodges when you try to do something in the real world. 
Workers-68|Manchester said he and his students. 
Workers-69|We're able to get a lot of work done by video. 
Workers-70|Even if some were working outside of the us. 
Workers-71|In their home countries. 
Workers-72|By the summer. 
Workers-73|They completed most of the programming and simulation. 
Workers-74|By september. 
Workers-75|Even his students who had been outside the us. 
Workers-76|Where in pittsburgh. 
Workers-77|That permits his lab to make a pretty big push. 
Workers-78|Into getting our stuff up and running on real hardware this fall he said. 
Workers-79|In the courtyard outside the robotics institute. 
Workers-80|Bart deister off a phd student from the netherlands. 
Workers-81|Talk with coa about his goals. 
Workers-82|He wants to find a way to reduce the cost of robots. 
Workers-83|So the average person. 
Workers-84|Can buy one. 
Workers-85|And make life more like a sci-fi movie. 
Workers-86|Syfy. 
Workers-87|Is short for science fiction. 
Workers-88|Meeting imaginative movies or books about the future. 
Workers-89|He once worked in aerospace. 
Workers-90|But moved to carnegie mellon. 
Workers-91|To learn more about computer science and robotics. 
Workers-92|Deister off also said he wants to test his ideas in the real world. 
Workers-93|Maybe we're just sitting. 
Workers-94|Previous column. 
Workers-95|Evan cohen is a master's student from pittsburgh. 
Workers-96|He said he is excited. 
Workers-97|About getting back to work in person. 
Workers-98|Because scientists often solve problems by accident. 
Workers-99|While video calls help people stay in touch he said. 
Workers-100|They do not let the scientists look around a lab. 
Workers-101|And see what other people are working on. 
Workers-102|It is much better to be on campus. 
Workers-103|We're students and professors can talk about their projects. 
Workers-104|In buildings and at places to eat. 
Workers-105|A lot of stuff i think it's just working side-by-side with someone and just something just kind of comes up out of nowhere i think for me that's some of the biggest breakthroughs i've has been just. 
Workers-107|Cohen explained that he and his classmates were trying to help robot. 
Workers-108|2 sense barriers. 
Workers-109|When meeting by video. 
Workers-110|They could not fix the problem. 
Workers-111|However. 
Workers-112|When they met in person and started tinkering with the robot. 
Workers-113|It was easier to guess and check their ideas. 
Workers-114|I had a whole year online. 
Workers-115|Some glad to experience a semester in person he said. 
Workers-116|I'm dan friedel. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-1|The official number of worldwide deaths from covid-19. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-2|Past 6 million on monday. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-3|The number shows how the pandemic now in its third year. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-4|Is far from over. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-5|The coronavirus research center at johns hopkins university in maryland. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-6|Recorded the total. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-7|The virus continues to kill large numbers of people. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-8|Even as people stop wearing face coverings. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-9|And begin to travel more freely. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-10|Small pacific islands are experiencing their first large spread of the virus. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-11|The isolation of such nations. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-12|Had protected them for more than 2 years. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-13|Hong kong is also seeing deaths quickly rise. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-14|It is testing its entire population of 7.5 million. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-15|Three times this month. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-16|Death rates remain high in poland hungry romania and other eastern european countries. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-17|The area has also seen more than 1.5 million refugees. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-18|Recently arrived from ukraine. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-19|Ukraine has had poor vaccination rates and high rates of cases. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-20|And deaths. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-21|The united states has recorded nearly 1 million deaths even with the country's high vaccine availability and wealth. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-22|The us has the highest official death toll in the world. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-23|Case numbers in the us have been dropping over the last month. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-24|Death rates worldwide are still highest among people who are not vaccinated against virus. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-25|Said tiki pawn. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-26|He is a professor at the national university of singapore is medical school. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-27|And former researcher with the world health organization. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-28|The large majority of the deaths and the severe cases are in the unvaccinated. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-29|Vulnerable segments of the population. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-30|Punk said. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-31|It took the world 7 months to record its first million deaths from the virus. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-32|After the pandemic began in early 2020. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-33|4 months later another million people had died. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-34|And 1 million have died every 3 months since. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-35|The death toll hit 5 million at the end of october. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-36|Now it has reached six million. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-37|The world very likely hit its six million death sometime ago. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-38|Poor record-keeping and testing. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-39|In many parts of the world has led to an undercount in coronavirus deaths. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-40|There has also been an undercount in excess deaths. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-41|Those are deaths related to the pandemic. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-42|But not from actual covid-19 infection. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-43|They include people who died from preventable causes. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-44|But could not receive treatments because hospitals were full. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-45|Research on excess deaths by a team at the economist. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-46|Estimates that the number of deaths from the pandemic. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-47|Is between 14.1 million. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-48|+ 23.8 million. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-49|The world has seen more than 445 million confirmed covid-19 cases. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-50|New weekly cases have been declining quickly in all areas of the world except for the western pacific. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-51|The world health organization reported this week. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-52|That includes china japan and south korea. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-53|The worldwide vaccine gap continues. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-54|Just 6.95% of people in poor countries. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-55|Are fully vaccinated. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-56|But more than 73% have been vaccinated in wealthy nations. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-57|Says research organization. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-58|Our world in data. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-59|However at the end of last month. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-60|Africa passed europe in the number of vaccine shots given daily. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-61|Still only 12.5% of the continents population. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-62|Has received two shots. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-63|With about 250,000 reported deaths. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-64|Africa's lower death rate is thought to be from under-reporting. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-65|There is also a younger and less mobile population there. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-66|Africa is a big question mark for me. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-67|Because it has been relatively spared from the worst so far. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-68|But it could just be a time bomb. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-69|Tom said. 
Worldwide_Pandemic-70|He noted the continents low vaccination rates.

Young_People-1|Young people all over the world. 
Young_People-2|Are seriously concerned about the state of politics. 
Young_People-3|And education. 
Young_People-4|That information comes from a survey. 
Young_People-5|By the organization for economic cooperation and development. 
Young_People-6|Or oecd. 
Young_People-7|The study looked at 151 youth organizations from 72 countries. 
Young_People-8|It centred on young people aged 15 to 29. 
Young_People-9|The researchers noted that people between those ages. 
Young_People-10|I've lived through two worldwide crisis.

Young_People-12|And the coronavirus pandemic. 
Young_People-13|Oecd researchers say it is important. 
Young_People-14|To learn the effects of the pandemic on younger people. 
Young_People-15|The pandemic they said. 
Young_People-16|Has affected different age groups differently. 
Young_People-17|And its repercussions will be felt by many for decades to come. 
Young_People-18|Youth organizations were asked to identify three areas. 
Young_People-19|In which young people were finding it most difficult. 
Young_People-20|To deal with the effects of covid-19. 
Young_People-21|The top answers were mental health. 
Young_People-22|Education and employment. 
Young_People-23|Other areas of concern were personal relationships. 
Young_People-24|Personal wealth. 
Young_People-25|And limits on individual freedom. 
Young_People-26|The researchers said the pandemics long-term effects on education. 
Young_People-27|Remain to be fully observed. 
Young_People-28|The study added that the crisis has greatly reduced international student mobility. 
Young_People-29|Widened educational differences across different populations. 
Young_People-30|And increased the risk of students attending their education. 
Young_People-31|An oecd study released this year. 
Young_People-32|Found that on average. 
Young_People-33|6% of 15 to 19 year olds in oecd countries. 
Young_People-34|We're not involved in employment. 
Young_People-35|Education or job training in 2020. 
Young_People-36|In poorer countries like colombia and brazil. 
Young_People-37|At least 20% of young people were not involved in employment education or training. 
Young_People-38|The effects of the crisis have been more severe the study said. 
Young_People-39|For young women. 
Young_People-40|Young people from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. 
Young_People-41|Young people not in employment education or training. 
Young_People-42|And other young people in vulnerable circumstances. 
Young_People-43|The study said. 
Young_People-44|Several countries have increased educational spending. 
Young_People-45|And sought to improve the lives of vulnerable groups. 
Young_People-46|Canada's government for example. 
Young_People-47|Provided money to help native groups complete secondary school. 
Young_People-48|The country also introduced more childcare support. 
Young_People-49|For young women.

Young_People-56|To get residency. 
Young_People-57|France belgium and estonia have started new programs and training. 
Young_People-58|For young people out of education and the workforce to build new skills. 
Young_People-59|Overall just three out of 32 oecd member countries studied by the researchers. 
Young_People-60|Iceland japan and luxembourg. 
Young_People-61|Did not target young people as part of their recovery plans. 
Young_People-62|Even with such efforts. 
Young_People-63|Young people's trust in government has decreased. 
Young_People-64|Since the pandemic started. 
Young_People-65|Of all countries taking part in the study. 
Young_People-66|37% of youth organizations. 
Young_People-67|Say their trust in government has decreased. 
Young_People-68|They also reported low levels of approval for government services. 
Young_People-69|Like healthcare. 
Young_People-70|Housing and education. 
Young_People-71|34% of youth organizations surveyed. 
Young_People-72|Also say they are less satisfied with democracy. 
Young_People-73|Many countries looked to build trust with young people by partnering with youth organizations in planning recovery measures. 
Young_People-74|Australia invited youth organizations to comment. 
Young_People-75|On the government's budget goals. 
Young_People-76|Estonia listed the national youth council. 
Young_People-77|As an important partner in the creation of its recovery plan. 
Young_People-78|Mexico question the 20,000 of its young citizens. 
Young_People-79|On issues like education employment. 
Young_People-80|Health and violence. 
Young_People-81|To inform policy measures. 
Young_People-82|When governments communicate proactively the researchers said. 
Young_People-83|They can generate citizen buying and engagement. 
Young_People-84|Including among young people. 
Young_People-85|I did novak. 
ebirth_of_Italy-1|The ancient italian city of pompeii. 
ebirth_of_Italy-2|Historically has had its fair share of ups and downs. 
ebirth_of_Italy-3|Back in 79 a.d.. 
ebirth_of_Italy-4|A volcano erupted. 
ebirth_of_Italy-5|And turned the lively city into a wasteland. 
ebirth_of_Italy-6|In just a few hours. 
ebirth_of_Italy-7|The destructive event buried the city and its people in volcanic ash. 
ebirth_of_Italy-8|Then in this century. 
ebirth_of_Italy-9|The excavated roman city seems close to a second death. 
ebirth_of_Italy-10|This time not by a volcano. 
ebirth_of_Italy-11|But by years of inattention. 
ebirth_of_Italy-12|And mismanagement of the heavily visited ruins. 
ebirth_of_Italy-13|In 2010 a building where ancient roman soldiers had trained. 
ebirth_of_Italy-14|Collapsed. 
ebirth_of_Italy-15|Because of this pompeii nearly lost its place. 
ebirth_of_Italy-16|As a unesco world heritage site. 
ebirth_of_Italy-17|And honor it received in 1997. 
ebirth_of_Italy-18|But if these days pompeii is beginning to experience a rebirth. 
ebirth_of_Italy-19|A restoration project to prevent more collapses. 
ebirth_of_Italy-20|Includes new excavations. 
ebirth_of_Italy-21|The work has led to discoveries about the everyday lives of the ancient people of pompeii. 
ebirth_of_Italy-22|The restoration is also helping to limit the effects of a new threat. 
ebirth_of_Italy-23|Climate change. 
ebirth_of_Italy-24|Climate extremes including increasingly intense rainfall. 
ebirth_of_Italy-25|And periods of extreme heat. 
ebirth_of_Italy-26|Threaten pompeii. 
ebirth_of_Italy-27|The new director of the ruins. 
ebirth_of_Italy-28|Archaeologists gabrielle zoo trigo. 
ebirth_of_Italy-29|Is using the latest computer technology to help restore pompeii. 
ebirth_of_Italy-30|He compares the ancient cities fast destruction. 
ebirth_of_Italy-31|Which began in the 1970s. 
ebirth_of_Italy-32|To an airplane going down to the ground. 
ebirth_of_Italy-33|And really risking breaking apart. 
ebirth_of_Italy-34|Some conditions are changing and we can already measure this. 
ebirth_of_Italy-35|Superego told the associated press. 
ebirth_of_Italy-36|The great pompeii project. 
ebirth_of_Italy-37|Was a 120 million-dollar restoration effort. 
ebirth_of_Italy-38|That ended in 2016. 
ebirth_of_Italy-39|It helped keep the ruins from further harm. 
ebirth_of_Italy-40|Zook trego said it was all spent. 
ebirth_of_Italy-41|Spent well. 
ebirth_of_Italy-42|However future problems are expected to develop for the ruins. 
ebirth_of_Italy-43|Which were first excavated 250 years ago. 
ebirth_of_Italy-44|The ruins at pompeii were first discovered in the 16th century. 
ebirth_of_Italy-45|Encyclopedia britannica says on its website. 
ebirth_of_Italy-46|Zut regal said that moving forward the use of new technology will be critical to help fight the ancient cities battle against time. 
ebirth_of_Italy-47|The treasures of pompeii include numerous pieces of art. 
ebirth_of_Italy-48|Found on the floors and walls. 
ebirth_of_Italy-49|Depending on humans alone to search for signs of climate caused damage would be nearly impossible. 
ebirth_of_Italy-50|So artificial intelligence tools and drones. 
ebirth_of_Italy-51|Will help collect and process data and images in real time. 
ebirth_of_Italy-52|Since last year ai and robots are doing what otherwise would be impossible jobs. 
ebirth_of_Italy-53|Such as putting wall paintings that have collapsed into very small pieces back together. 
ebirth_of_Italy-54|Among the goals is to rebuild the painted ceiling of the house of the painters at work. 
ebirth_of_Italy-55|It was destroyed by allied bombing during world war ii. 
ebirth_of_Italy-56|Robots will also help repair damage to collapsed structures in a building believed to have been used by roman soldiers. 
ebirth_of_Italy-57|17 of pompeii is 66 hectares remain unexcavated. 
ebirth_of_Italy-58|They are still buried deep under lava stone. 
ebirth_of_Italy-59|There is a long-running debate over whether they should stay buried. 
ebirth_of_Italy-60|At the start of the 19th century. 
ebirth_of_Italy-61|Zut regal said. 
ebirth_of_Italy-62|The idea was to excavate all of pompeii. 
ebirth_of_Italy-63|But in the years leading up to the great pompeii project. 
ebirth_of_Italy-64|People were not quick to excavate. 
ebirth_of_Italy-65|Nutribullet said the thinking was because we have so many problems we won't excavate anymore. 
ebirth_of_Italy-66|The head archaeologist before him mozzy malasana. 
ebirth_of_Italy-67|Took a different approach to the restoration. 
ebirth_of_Italy-68|Osana targeted excavation in places that needed to be fixed and strengthened. 
ebirth_of_Italy-69|This aimed to prevent further collapses. 
ebirth_of_Italy-70|But it was a different kind of excavation. 
ebirth_of_Italy-71|It was part of a larger approach. 
ebirth_of_Italy-72|Where we have the combination of protection research and accessibility. 
ebirth_of_Italy-73|Suit regal said. 
ebirth_of_Italy-74|Today the goals of the pompeii park. 
ebirth_of_Italy-75|Go further than protecting ruins. 
ebirth_of_Italy-76|The nearby towns have suffered from organized crime. 
ebirth_of_Italy-77|And high youth unemployment. 
ebirth_of_Italy-78|This has caused many young people to leave. 
ebirth_of_Italy-79|So the archaeological park is bringing together students from the areas wealthy institutions. 
ebirth_of_Italy-80|And students from working-class neighborhoods. 
ebirth_of_Italy-81|They will perform together at pompey's great theater. 
ebirth_of_Italy-82|We can try to contribute to a change zouk trigo said. 
ebirth_of_Italy-83|There are also plans to create public walking grounds in an unexcavated part of pompeii. 
ebirth_of_Italy-84|That part of the ruins until recently. 
ebirth_of_Italy-85|Have been used as an illegal waste dump. 
ebirth_of_Italy-86|And even a marijuana farm. 
ebirth_of_Italy-87|I'm on a mateo.
