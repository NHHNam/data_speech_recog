Africa_Still_Fa-31|and Kanga song said such Nations cannot possibly compete with other countries in the international marketplace for vaccines
Africa_Still_Fa-32|by comparison the United States and Britain have fully vaccinated more than 40% of their populations

Africa_Still_Fa-38|and Kanga song called on the leaders of wealthy Nations meeting this week at the Group of Seven to share available vaccine supplies

Africa_Still_Fa-54|is meaningless unless they share their excess vaccine
Africa_Still_Fa-55|they say that while they're hoarding the vaccine
Africa_Still_Fa-56|Ibrahim said
Africa_Still_Fa-57|can you walk the talk
Africa_Still_Fa-58|stop just talking like parrots do you really mean what you said

China_Hope-24|PM 2.5 is a form of pollution in the air
China_Hope-25|in 2016 the level of PM 2.5 pollution
China_Hope-26|in the Beijing Tianjin ho Bay Area
China_Hope-27|was 71 micrograms per cubic meter
China_Hope-28|the level Rose to more than 500 micrograms over the winter
China_Hope-29|that is compared to an average of 40 micrograms from January to September of 2021
China_Hope-30|the reading in Beijing was 33 micrograms in the first nine months of the year
China_Hope-31|that means China's 35 micrograms limit
China_Hope-32|but it is higher than the level suggested by the World Health Organization

China_Hope-34|Daydreams pollution levels are likely to rise much higher over the winter
China_Hope-35|China will win many medals at the Winter Olympics
China_Hope-36|but the smog could plunge the games into difficulties
China_Hope-37|said the international fund for China's environment
China_Hope-38|a washington-based group earlier this year
China_Hope-39|officials said during a government organized trip recently
China_Hope-40|that all 26 Olympic areas in Beijing and hebei province
China_Hope-41|would be completely powered by renewable energy
China_Hope-42|more than 700 hydrogen-powered Vehicles will also be used
China_Hope-43|China has said it would make the game's carbon-neutral for the first time
China_Hope-44|Environmental Group Greenpeace said without more information
China_Hope-45|it would be hard to know whether the goal of not increasing carbon gases in the atmosphere was Matt
China_Hope-46|water shortages are another concern
China_Hope-47|especially for the efforts to make artificial snow and ice
China_Hope-48|organizers said the games would not put additional pressure on local Water Supplies

China_Traveli-3|have become International Stars
China_Traveli-4|the 15-member heard was already receiving wide coverage in China
China_Traveli-5|but now the group's long trip is being documented
China_Traveli-6|by Major media companies and on social media
China_Traveli-7|the elephants are traveling from their home in a mountainous area of Yunnan province
China_Traveli-8|toward the city of Kunming
China_Traveli-9|YouTube and Twitter are full of video clips showing interesting behavior of the animals as they continue their path
China_Traveli-10|across Farmland Villages and around cities
China_Traveli-11|one of the most popular Clips showed two young elephants being helped out of a ditch by older members of the group
China_Traveli-12|the elephants have also drawn widespread attention on China's weibo social media service
China_Traveli-13|pictures of the group sleeping received 25000 posts
China_Traveli-14|and more than 200 million views
China_Traveli-15|the herd has been filmed continuously from the sky by drones
China_Traveli-16|and caught on security cameras walking down city streets
China_Traveli-17|the elephants are being followed by individuals seeking to limit damage from the animals
China_Traveli-18|and to keep them and people safe
China_Traveli-19|while no animals were people have been hurt during the trip
China_Traveli-20|media reports have estimated crop damage to be more than $1000000
China_Traveli-21|the elephants have invaded Farms looking for food and water
China_Traveli-22|visited a car dealership
China_Traveli-23|and even showed up at a retirement home
China_Traveli-24|at the home some elephants attempted to visit rooms leading one man to hide under his bed
China_Traveli-25|16 animals started out in the group
China_Traveli-26|but the government says to returned home and a baby was born during the walk
China_Traveli-27|officials in China say they are not sure exactly what persuaded the elephants to make their long trip
China_Traveli-28|they do however seem to be drawn to corn
China_Traveli-29|fruits and other tasty crops they find along the way

China_Traveli-35|of the World Wildlife Fund
China_Traveli-36|in this case we don't really know why they left their home range
China_Traveli-37|she told the Associated Press
China_Traveli-38|she added that the area where they lived
China_Traveli-39|had seen major habitat loss linked to agriculture expansion
China_Traveli-40|what possibly happened here is that in their search for new habitat
China_Traveli-41|they got lost along the way and kept going Jaya singer added
China_Traveli-42|elephants are given the top level of protection in China
China_Traveli-43|this permits their numbers to continually increase even as their natural habitat shrinks
China_Traveli-44|Chinese officials have ordered people to stay inside and not to look at the elephants or try to keep them away
China_Traveli-45|was fireworks or other things
China_Traveli-46|officials in cities have used trucks and building equipment
China_Traveli-47|to block the animals from entering
China_Traveli-48|and have dropped food to keep them away
China_Traveli-49|as of Tuesday the herd remained outside Kunming a city of seven million people
China_Traveli-50|officials in the area said in a statement Monday a command center had been set up
China_Traveli-51|to watch the elephants
China_Traveli-52|more than 400 emergency workers and police were standing by and the herd was being watched by 14 drones
China_Traveli-53|people living nearby were ordered to leave the area

Controlled_Burn-1|in the 1950s
Controlled_Burn-2|University of California Professor Harold bizwell
Controlled_Burn-3|experimented with controlled Burns in the state's forests
Controlled_Burn-4|at the time
Controlled_Burn-5|many people thought he was insane to do so
Controlled_Burn-6|now however
Controlled_Burn-7|as well as seem not as insane but as someone whose research could he's Wildfire dangers
Controlled_Burn-8|and save the forest
Controlled_Burn-9|of the American West
Controlled_Burn-10|large areas of forest have become overgrown in the American West
Controlled_Burn-11|these lands have had wildfires that have damaged towns
Controlled_Burn-12|Forest large evacuations
Controlled_Burn-13|and covered the West Coast in Thick Smoke
Controlled_Burn-14|today
Controlled_Burn-15|officials want to greatly increase prescribed fires
Controlled_Burn-16|fire set on purpose
Controlled_Burn-17|and under carefully controlled conditions
Controlled_Burn-18|prescribed fires help clear surface fuels in forests
Controlled_Burn-19|last month
Controlled_Burn-20|four US senators proposed legislation called the national prescribed fire Act of 2021
Controlled_Burn-21|it's called for federal officials to substantially increase the number and size
Controlled_Burn-22|I've prescribed fires on federal lands
Controlled_Burn-23|one of the Bill's supporters
Controlled_Burn-24|Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon
Controlled_Burn-25|said the legislation would double the budget for controlled Burns
Controlled_Burn-26|it took years for Forest managers to come around to accept prescribed burning
Controlled_Burn-27|in the first half of the 20th century
Controlled_Burn-28|fire was seen as the enemy
Controlled_Burn-29|federal and state forest managers believed prescribed burning damaged the environment
Controlled_Burn-30|especially Timber
Controlled_Burn-31|wood manufactured to build things
Controlled_Burn-32|but in the late 1960s and 1970s
Controlled_Burn-33|Federal Forest managers began using prescribed Burns
Controlled_Burn-34|yet the increase in prescribed Burns has been slow
Controlled_Burn-35|from 1995 through 2000
Controlled_Burn-36|an average of 566560 hectares
Controlled_Burn-37|we're treated with prescribed fire each year
Controlled_Burn-38|that amount is far short of the 28 million hectares
Controlled_Burn-39|that in 2001
Controlled_Burn-40|where in great need of fuel reduction to avoid serious wildfires
Controlled_Burn-41|scientist David Carl wrote in his 2002 book
Controlled_Burn-42|burning questions
Controlled_Burn-43|America's fight with Nature's fire
Controlled_Burn-44|the latest prescribed burning plans face several problems
Controlled_Burn-45|the periods between Wildfire Seasons when prescribed burning can happen safely
Controlled_Burn-46|are shrinking
Controlled_Burn-47|some forests are too overgrown to burn without thinning
Controlled_Burn-48|and prescribed fires can fill nearby towns in Smoke
Controlled_Burn-49|Tim whole stock is Deputy Chief of policy and planning with Oregon's Department of Forestry
Controlled_Burn-50|we have to be mindful of not pouring smoke into communities
Controlled_Burn-51|because that's a violation of the Clean Air Act
Controlled_Burn-52|ostokset
Controlled_Burn-53|prescribed burning has prevented disasters
Controlled_Burn-54|in 2017 a wildfire threatened the town of Sisters Oregon
Controlled_Burn-55|but firefighters were able to control it because months earlier
Controlled_Burn-56|workers had removed trees and fresh and then carried out prescribed Burns
Controlled_Burn-57|the fire came to a halt
Controlled_Burn-58|both because it had less fuels
Controlled_Burn-59|and also because in the thinned more natural Forest
Controlled_Burn-60|there was a lot more space for the firefighters
Controlled_Burn-61|said Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon
Controlled_Burn-62|he leads the Senate interior environment and related agencies Appropriations subcommittee
Controlled_Burn-63|however
Controlled_Burn-64|sometimes prescribed Burns become uncontrollable
Controlled_Burn-65|one of the most destructive Burns happened in 2012
Controlled_Burn-66|the Colorado State Forest Service did a 20 ha prescribed burn near the small town of Conifer
Controlled_Burn-67|Southwest of Denver
Controlled_Burn-68|the fire appeared to go out that's expected
Controlled_Burn-69|but
Controlled_Burn-70|high winds brought it back to life
Controlled_Burn-71|several people died in the fire which burned 15.5 square kilometers
Controlled_Burn-72|and destroyed over 20 homes
Controlled_Burn-73|Scott Stevens
Controlled_Burn-74|a professor of Wildland fire science at the University of California
Controlled_Burn-75|Berkeley
Controlled_Burn-76|once a big increase in prescribed Burns
Controlled_Burn-77|but Stephens predict
Controlled_Burn-78|search Burns will only slowly increase
Controlled_Burn-79|due to a lack of both trained workers
Controlled_Burn-80|and public support
Controlled_Burn-81|once you get areas treated
Controlled_Burn-82|you have to come back in around 15 years for maintenance treatments
Controlled_Burn-83|and just never ends
Controlled_Burn-84|Stevens said
Controlled_Burn-85|this is a key point
Controlled_Burn-86|the program has to last forever

Facial_Recognit-1|big technology companies like Amazon have said they are limiting their sale of facial recognition software to law enforcement agencies
Facial_Recognit-2|Clearview AI has not
Facial_Recognit-3|it is a private company based in New York City
Facial_Recognit-4|Clearview AI provides a facial recognition search engine that contains 3 billion images taken from the internet
Facial_Recognit-5|the search engine identifies images of people's faces
Facial_Recognit-6|the company says more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies use the software
Facial_Recognit-7|wonton tap is the chief executive and co-founder of the company
Facial_Recognit-8|he said the way it works is very similar to Google
Facial_Recognit-9|but instead of putting in words
Facial_Recognit-10|you're pudding and photos of faces
Facial_Recognit-11|and it will find anything publicly available on the internet that looks like that face
Facial_Recognit-12|police say facial recognition software is an important tool in fighting and solving crimes
Facial_Recognit-13|but it's increasing use as raised concerns that there are too few rules and plays for when and how police can use it
Facial_Recognit-14|police usually have image search engines which can look at driver's license pictures or other images among police records
Facial_Recognit-15|Clearview AI has billions of images gathered from social media and other sites
Facial_Recognit-16|internet companies have said the images were taken by breaking their rules
Facial_Recognit-17|however Clearview AI Staunton said that the company only takes publicly available information
Facial_Recognit-18|Clearview AI describes a case on its website in which federal agents were able to identify a man suspected of sexual abuse of a girl from one image using a search engine
Facial_Recognit-19|contact said the software has also been used to identify suspects who stormed the US Capitol in January
Facial_Recognit-20|he said Clearview AI was useful in the investigation of many people who may not have had pictures in police databases
Facial_Recognit-21|a search using Clearview AI search engine takes about 1 second
Facial_Recognit-22|contact said police were able to quickly identify the suspects from the January 6th incident
Facial_Recognit-23|they could also reduce false results
Facial_Recognit-24|and speed up the investigation process
Facial_Recognit-25|when protests against police methods happened in the United States last year
Facial_Recognit-26|Amazon and some other companies band sales of facial recognition technology to law enforcement
Facial_Recognit-27|they have not said when they will restart
Facial_Recognit-28|Clearview AI continues to provide services to law enforcement agencies
Facial_Recognit-29|internet companies like Facebook Google and Twitter and civil rights activist
Facial_Recognit-30|are warning about its power and possible abuse of people's privacy
Facial_Recognit-31|the American civil liberties Union or ACLU is a nonprofit Rights group
Facial_Recognit-32|it has brought legal action against Clearview AI in Chicago and in California
Facial_Recognit-33|Kate ruane is a lawyer for the ACLU
Facial_Recognit-34|she said facial recognition technology makes it possible for the government to watch every part of citizens lives
Facial_Recognit-35|federal state and local governments she said do admit they use it but they don't tell us how when or how often
Facial_Recognit-36|she said there needs to be more laws and supervision
Facial_Recognit-37|she is calling for a total freeze on the technology until then
Facial_Recognit-38|in recent months
Facial_Recognit-39|lawmakers have introduced bills that would limit Police use of data they buy that is illegally obtained
Facial_Recognit-40|Dante that agrees that there needs to be more openness and even rules for the Technologies use
Facial_Recognit-41|but he does not think it should be banned for police use
Facial_Recognit-42|he said it has been successful in solving crimes
Facial_Recognit-43|contact also says that people who use the system must agree to observe its rules
Facial_Recognit-44|he said messages that appear in the software help prevent its misuse
Facial_Recognit-45|the ACLU and other civil rights groups also say they are concerned about what could happen if governments like China have the technology
Facial_Recognit-46|contact said his company does not sell it software to foreign governments
Facial_Recognit-47|he mainly serves law enforcement agencies in the US
Facial_Recognit-48|contact said the company has worked with some private organizations for investigative purposes
Facial_Recognit-49|but they have decided to stay with law enforcement
Facial_Recognit-50|he said it's the easiest most explainable and best use case of our technology

Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-1|Greenland's glaciers
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-2|continue to melt away because of rising global temperatures
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-3|but the melting ice might provide a way to lessen the impacts of climate change
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-4|as the ice melts it deposits tiny silt
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-5|silt is very small sand mud or other material
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-6|carried by running water
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-7|it's a kind of Wonder material said Minnick Rosen
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-8|he is a native Greenland ER and professor at the University of Copenhagen
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-9|cold glacial Rock flour
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-10|the silt is crushed to tiny particles by the weights of the melting ice
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-11|1 billion tons of the silt is deposited per year on Greenland
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-12|the world's largest island
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-13|bruising and his team have found the nutrient-rich mud improves plant growth when used in farms
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-14|it also absorbs carbon dioxide from the air in the process
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-15|researchers from the University of Ghana
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-16|we're able to increase corn production by 30% using glacial Rock flour
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-17|the flower decrease the effect of rain and heat on poor farmland
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-18|the tiny size of the silts particles
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-19|is what allows plants more access to nutrients including potassium
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-20|calcium and silicon
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-21|compared to normal Rocky farmland
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-22|we are the stage in this project where we definitely know that it works
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-23|roesing said
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-24|there are many barriers between this and a big-scale industry
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-25|but the potential is definitely there
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-26|the tiny size of the stilts particles also helps speed up a natural process
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-27|in which rocks absorb carbon dioxide
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-28|or CO2
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-29|when the Celtics dissolves in rainwater and releases its nutrients
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-30|a chemical reaction occurs that absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-31|the silt is eventually deposited in the sea
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-32|the idea of putting tiny Rock in Farmland is not new
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-33|but the method has gained more interest because of the discovery that it can absorb CO2
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-34|that realization has been a catalyst for a lot more research in this area
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-35|said David beerling
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-36|he is a professor at the University of Sheffield
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-37|and head author of a study on crushed basalt
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-38|a tiny volcanic rock
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-39|the study found that spreading finally crushed Basalt on fields
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-40|as well as helping crops to grow
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-41|remove CO2 from the atmosphere
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-42|and it does so at a cost about equal to other methods of carbon capture
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-43|such detailed research has not been done for glacial Rock flour
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-44|but tests by the scientist in Copenhagen
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-45|found that one ton of glacial Rock flour would accept between 250 and 300 kg of CO2
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-46|when applied to fields
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-47|that may also permit Farmers to sell that as carbon credits
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-48|Greenland's new government hopes the sales can one day help the economy
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-49|as well as permits the country to move away from some kinds of mining
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-50|we don't need to blast off the top of a mountain
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-51|or build a processing plant
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-52|Greenland's resources Minister told possible investors in September
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-53|government officials will present the mineral at a mining meeting in Vancouver early next year
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-54|what's a commercial Mining and use could be years away
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-55|the scientists at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Ghana
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-56|say success could improve food security
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-57|and economic inequality
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-58|good Farmland is not equally spread around the world
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-59|studies show that the best Farmland which is across parts of North America and Europe
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-60|was covered by Ice during the last ice age
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-61|just as in Greenland's today
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-62|the thick layer of ice has made the soil healthier
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-63|in northern Europe
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-64|we think the reason we're better off than the rest of the world
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-65|is that we are so much smarter than everyone else
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-66|in fact
Melting_Glaciers_Uncover_Nutrient-Rich_Soil-67|we just have better soil

Oyster_Farmers_-1|have you ever seen an ugly oyster
Oyster_Farmers_-2|that is the term oyster farmers use
Oyster_Farmers_-3|for the sea animals
Oyster_Farmers_-4|when their shells get too large to sell to seafood restaurants
Oyster_Farmers_-5|each year Farmers grow oysters
Oyster_Farmers_-6|to just the right size so people at restaurants will enjoy eating them
Oyster_Farmers_-7|if they get too big
Oyster_Farmers_-8|restaurants no longer want to buy them
Oyster_Farmers_-9|so last year when many seafood restaurants in the US closed
Oyster_Farmers_-10|due to the covid-19 pandemic
Oyster_Farmers_-11|oyster Farmers lost the chance to sell their product
Oyster_Farmers_-12|suddenly
Oyster_Farmers_-13|they had a lot of uglies and nothing to do with them
Oyster_Farmers_-14|that was a big problem
Oyster_Farmers_-15|until a conservation program came to the rescue
Oyster_Farmers_-16|the program is called supporting oyster aquaculture and restoration
Oyster_Farmers_-17|or sore
Oyster_Farmers_-18|it is buying more than 5 million oysters
Oyster_Farmers_-19|at the cost of about 2 million dollars
Oyster_Farmers_-20|from Farmers
Oyster_Farmers_-21|on the east coast of the US
Oyster_Farmers_-22|and in Washington State
Oyster_Farmers_-23|Farmers tape living oysters that are too big to sell and send them to places like the Great Bay
Oyster_Farmers_-24|in the northeastern State of New Hampshire
Oyster_Farmers_-25|oysters are placed in the water
Oyster_Farmers_-26|in special locations called reefs
Oyster_Farmers_-27|once they attached to the structures in the water
Oyster_Farmers_-28|they can live for a number of years
Oyster_Farmers_-29|they helped create a good environment for other sea life
Oyster_Farmers_-30|the hope is that the oysters will help clean the water
Oyster_Farmers_-31|and also have babies
Oyster_Farmers_-32|Chris burtis is an oyster Farmer in the state of Maine
Oyster_Farmers_-33|he called the program
Oyster_Farmers_-34|kind of a lifesaver
Oyster_Farmers_-35|Lisa Calvano runs sweet Amalia oyster Farm in Southern New Jersey
Oyster_Farmers_-36|she said the program helped her business get through the pandemic and stay afloat
Oyster_Farmers_-37|an unknown person donated money to the program which was organised by the Pew charitable trusts and The Nature Conservancy
Oyster_Farmers_-38|the group's work together with the US Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
Oyster_Farmers_-39|which ran similar programs in other parts of the US
Oyster_Farmers_-40|calvo started her Farm about 20 years ago
Oyster_Farmers_-41|she sells her oysters to restaurants close to Philadelphia Pennsylvania
Oyster_Farmers_-42|and those in the towns along the ocean in New Jersey
Oyster_Farmers_-43|oysters are ready to sell when they are about 2 years old
Oyster_Farmers_-44|when all the restaurants started closing
Oyster_Farmers_-45|she said
Oyster_Farmers_-46|she was in a panic
Oyster_Farmers_-47|basically you know my eggs were in that restaurant basket
Oyster_Farmers_-48|she was able to earn about half the usual amount of money
Oyster_Farmers_-49|by selling her oysters to the program
Oyster_Farmers_-50|that was better than nothing
Oyster_Farmers_-51|the program helped her pay her employees and get ready for the next stir season
Oyster_Farmers_-52|the money allowed her to grow oysters that she could sell this year when prices returned to normal
Oyster_Farmers_-53|she said working to keep the large oysters healthy
Oyster_Farmers_-54|when they could not be sold would have hurt her business
Oyster_Farmers_-55|and she could not give up on the young or sisters either
Oyster_Farmers_-56|it wasn't like I could just walk away from the farm
Oyster_Farmers_-57|because it's there so much intensive labor
Oyster_Farmers_-58|particularly during the spring and summer is the Twisters are growing
Oyster_Farmers_-59|rapidly
Oyster_Farmers_-60|you can't just walk away from an oyster farm and come back when the markets good again
Oyster_Farmers_-61|calvo is not just an oyster farmer
Oyster_Farmers_-62|before she started her Farm she studied ocean science
Oyster_Farmers_-63|she said the program should restore the reefs and help oysters and other sea animals
Oyster_Farmers_-64|oysters can live for five to six years
Oyster_Farmers_-65|so they will produce young oysters for many more years
Oyster_Farmers_-66|that is important
Oyster_Farmers_-67|The Nature Conservancy says there are 85%
Oyster_Farmers_-68|fewer oyster reefs than in the past due to disease pollution
Oyster_Farmers_-69|and overfishing
Oyster_Farmers_-70|similar smaller programs
Oyster_Farmers_-71|we're successful in the past in the ocean off the coast of New Hampshire
Oyster_Farmers_-72|Raymond Grizzle
Oyster_Farmers_-73|is a professor
Oyster_Farmers_-74|at the University of New Hampshire
Oyster_Farmers_-75|he studies oysters
Oyster_Farmers_-76|he said the project is a good experiment
Oyster_Farmers_-77|we are hoping for the best
Oyster_Farmers_-78|it's almost a sure thing
Oyster_Farmers_-79|that they are going to do some good he said
Oyster_Farmers_-80|calvo said the program helps her during a bad time but the business lessons she learned during the pandemic
Oyster_Farmers_-81|should help her in the future
Oyster_Farmers_-82|now she is able to sell oysters directly to customers who come to her Farm
Oyster_Farmers_-83|she also sells items from other producers in her area
Oyster_Farmers_-84|I almost wish I had planted more oysters last year she said right now
Oyster_Farmers_-85|the restaurants haven't even fully open yet
Oyster_Farmers_-86|and they're already ordering more oysters
Oyster_Farmers_-87|then they ever have

Top_Finance_Off-1|top Finance officials from the G7 industrialized nations agreed on Saturday to the idea of a worldwide minimum tax
Top_Finance_Off-2|for international corporations
Top_Finance_Off-3|observers say the agreement signals coming changes to laws
Top_Finance_Off-4|for taxing businesses across borders in the future
Top_Finance_Off-5|however many details have yet to be worked out
Top_Finance_Off-6|before a larger group of Nations
Top_Finance_Off-7|the G20
Top_Finance_Off-8|is likely to give its support to the idea
Top_Finance_Off-9|G20 officials are expected to meet next month
Top_Finance_Off-10|here are some of the details that have been agreed on
Top_Finance_Off-11|the G7 agreement of having a worldwide tax rate for international corporations of at least 15%
Top_Finance_Off-12|now faces another test
Top_Finance_Off-13|an online meeting of the organization for economic cooperation and development
Top_Finance_Off-14|is planned for June 30th to July 1st
Top_Finance_Off-15|the oecd is based in Paris
Top_Finance_Off-16|in that meeting a group of 139 countries
Top_Finance_Off-17|we'll negotiate the idea with the aim of reaching agreement
Top_Finance_Off-18|an additional details
Top_Finance_Off-19|any agreement these nations reach
Top_Finance_Off-20|will be studied by a meeting of G20 Finance ministers
Top_Finance_Off-21|who are meeting in July
Top_Finance_Off-22|observers say if the G20 countries agree to the minimum tax
Top_Finance_Off-23|then it would likely become a worldwide rule
Top_Finance_Off-24|the idea of a worldwide minimum tax
Top_Finance_Off-25|is that it gives countries the ability to tax company profits
Top_Finance_Off-26|even if they are reported in countries with low tax rates
Top_Finance_Off-27|the G7 Finance officials
Top_Finance_Off-28|what's the minimum tax to be used for individual countries
Top_Finance_Off-29|they do not appear to support using an average rate
Top_Finance_Off-30|for all countries in which a business might operate
Top_Finance_Off-31|here is an example of how the tax might work
Top_Finance_Off-32|if a US company reports of profit in the British Virgin Islands
Top_Finance_Off-33|which has no corporate tax
Top_Finance_Off-34|u.s. tax officials
Top_Finance_Off-35|could still tax that companies profits
Top_Finance_Off-36|at a rate of 15%
Top_Finance_Off-37|G7 ministers are also discussing how to tax the biggest International companies
Top_Finance_Off-38|like Apple and Google
Top_Finance_Off-39|those details have not been made final
Top_Finance_Off-40|however some Industries such as the mining industry are likely to be exempt
Top_Finance_Off-41|because of the way they pay governments
Top_Finance_Off-42|and make profits
Top_Finance_Off-43|also
Top_Finance_Off-44|countries such as China
Top_Finance_Off-45|want to protect low-tax special economic areas
Top_Finance_Off-46|to support investment and development
Top_Finance_Off-47|the oecd estimated in October
Top_Finance_Off-48|but a worldwide minimum tax
Top_Finance_Off-49|would provide 100 billion dollars in additional tax income each year
Top_Finance_Off-50|for governments around the world
Top_Finance_Off-51|that is about 4%
Top_Finance_Off-52|of all income tax collected around the world
Top_Finance_Off-53|in one year
Top_Finance_Off-54|well that is a lot of money
Top_Finance_Off-55|it is a small amount
Top_Finance_Off-56|when compared to the trillions of dollars
Top_Finance_Off-57|large countries have spent
Top_Finance_Off-58|because of the covid-19
Top_Finance_Off-59|Health crisis

US_Considers_La-1|a top Federal Reserve official
US_Considers_La-2|said the United States is moving forward with a plan to develop a central bank digital currency
US_Considers_La-3|or cbdc
US_Considers_La-4|the US would not be the first country to consider launching such a currency
US_Considers_La-5|China is also considering one
US_Considers_La-6|however the US dollar is very important in the world economy
US_Considers_La-7|supporters of a cbdc
US_Considers_La-8|say it makes electronic payments faster and simpler
US_Considers_La-9|they say there is no need for a bank to take part in The Exchange
US_Considers_La-10|and people without a bank account
US_Considers_La-11|could receive secure electronic payments
US_Considers_La-12|but critics have concerns about privacy
US_Considers_La-13|they say such a system could give the federal government's control over people's Financial transactions
US_Considers_La-14|there are also economic concerns that the digital dollar could displace the currencies of smaller countries
US_Considers_La-15|David Treat
US_Considers_La-16|is with the Irish company Accenture
US_Considers_La-17|which gives business advice
US_Considers_La-18|he has worked with most central banks in G20 countries
US_Considers_La-19|20 large industrialized nations
US_Considers_La-20|he thinks about five of them will have some kind of digital currency by 2024
US_Considers_La-21|China's digital yuan is already in limited use
US_Considers_La-22|experts believe that CBD seas are likely to be used in the future
US_Considers_La-23|here are some strengths and weaknesses of digital currencies
US_Considers_La-24|a digital US dollar
US_Considers_La-25|would be worth exactly $1
US_Considers_La-26|other digital currencies like Bitcoin
US_Considers_La-27|can gain or lose value quickly compared to national currencies
US_Considers_La-28|but the digital token
US_Considers_La-29|held by the owner
US_Considers_La-30|would be guaranteed by the US Federal Reserve
US_Considers_La-31|Bitcoin for example is backed by no government
US_Considers_La-32|Tariq said
US_Considers_La-33|there is no question as to its value
US_Considers_La-34|whether it's the dollar in your wallet
US_Considers_La-35|the dollar in your savings account
US_Considers_La-36|or the Central Bank digital currency version of $1 in your digital wallet
US_Considers_La-37|all of them always equals $1
US_Considers_La-38|digital currencies involve fewer steps in a transaction
US_Considers_La-39|digital transactions on services like venmo seem simple
US_Considers_La-40|but there is a complex digital Network behind them
US_Considers_La-41|Banks and other Financial Services exchange information
US_Considers_La-42|to make sure the transaction is safe
US_Considers_La-43|if one step goes wrong
US_Considers_La-44|the payment can be delayed
US_Considers_La-45|experts say a digital currency
US_Considers_La-46|would work like cash
US_Considers_La-47|all the information needed to verify the transaction exists in the digital wallet
US_Considers_La-48|two people could even make a transaction without an internet connection
US_Considers_La-49|although a wireless connection is still required
US_Considers_La-50|a digital dollar could also be used around the world and across borders
US_Considers_La-51|Daniel dorfen
US_Considers_La-52|is a director of the digital dollar project
US_Considers_La-53|a nonprofit organization that supports a digital dollar
US_Considers_La-54|he said a digital dollar would reduce cost
US_Considers_La-55|for cross-border exchanges
US_Considers_La-56|smartphones are widely used in some of the world's poorest countries
US_Considers_La-57|cbdcs could bring many people around the world into the digital economy
US_Considers_La-58|gorfine said
US_Considers_La-59|the experiences of countries like Kenya
US_Considers_La-60|show that digital access can have a strongly inclusive effect
US_Considers_La-61|on underserved populations
US_Considers_La-62|however
US_Considers_La-63|digital currencies are a cause for concern
US_Considers_La-64|for supporters of personal privacy
US_Considers_La-65|under a digital dollar system
US_Considers_La-66|the Federal Reserve would have control over many transactions by citizens
US_Considers_La-67|critics point to China
US_Considers_La-68|where the government uses digital currency
US_Considers_La-69|to watch citizens transactions
US_Considers_La-70|a digital dollar
US_Considers_La-71|could also weaken local currencies
US_Considers_La-72|it might be good for individual people
US_Considers_La-73|to be able to buy and sell Goods in US dollars
US_Considers_La-74|but it would be bad for countries trying to supervise their own National currencies
US_Considers_La-75|a strong digital dollar
US_Considers_La-76|would reduce the value of a local currency
US_Considers_La-77|it would also harm other central banks ability to control their money supplies
US_Considers_La-78|gorfine said it is a problem that must be dealt with
US_Considers_La-79|he said it could be a good idea to limit the amount of digital dollars a person can hold at one time
US_Considers_La-80|he added that as digital currencies get more popular
US_Considers_La-81|it is important that they be supported by strong democracies
US_Considers_La-82|in the long-term
US_Considers_La-83|it is a good thing for any digital currency to be underpinned by rule of law

Why_Is_It_Diffi-6|to pay what is known as Ransom
Why_Is_It_Diffi-7|in exchange for releasing control of computer systems
Why_Is_It_Diffi-8|the software these criminals use is called ransomware
Why_Is_It_Diffi-9|reporters have started calling the groups carrying out the attacks
Why_Is_It_Diffi-10|ransomware gangs or cybercriminals
Why_Is_It_Diffi-11|the growing problems caused by these gangs raise a clear question
Why_Is_It_Diffi-12|why is the United States
Why_Is_It_Diffi-13|so powerless
Why_Is_It_Diffi-14|to protect its citizens from these kinds of criminals
Why_Is_It_Diffi-15|on Monday however the government signaled that it could move against the cybercriminals
Why_Is_It_Diffi-16|by recovering Ransom money
Why_Is_It_Diffi-17|Deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco
Why_Is_It_Diffi-18|said at a news conference
Why_Is_It_Diffi-19|but the justice department had recovered most of a multimillion-dollar ransom payment to hackers by the operator of the nation's largest fuel pipeline
Why_Is_It_Diffi-20|Colonial pipeline
Why_Is_It_Diffi-21|in the US state of Georgia
Why_Is_It_Diffi-22|supplies almost half the fuel used in the country's eastern coast
Why_Is_It_Diffi-23|the company temporarily shut down its operations on May 7th
Why_Is_It_Diffi-24|after a gang of criminal hackers
Why_Is_It_Diffi-25|call Darkside
Why_Is_It_Diffi-26|illegally entered its computer system
Why_Is_It_Diffi-27|Colonial officials said they closed their pipeline system
Why_Is_It_Diffi-28|and decided to pay a ransom
Why_Is_It_Diffi-29|about 4.4 million dollars
Why_Is_It_Diffi-30|so they could restart as soon as possible
Why_Is_It_Diffi-31|Monday's announcement was the first time the government has said that it had recovered money from their russia-based gang
Why_Is_It_Diffi-32|us officials say they are dealing with the threat of computer attacks aggressively
Why_Is_It_Diffi-33|Monica said
Why_Is_It_Diffi-34|we will continue to use all of our tools
Why_Is_It_Diffi-35|and all of our resources
Why_Is_It_Diffi-36|to increase the cost

Why_Is_It_Diffi-42|later this month

Why_Is_It_Diffi-44|the Biden Administration has also promised to take action to defend against further attacks
Why_Is_It_Diffi-45|it plans to improve efforts to bring charges against those responsible
Why_Is_It_Diffi-46|and form diplomatic agreements with other countries
Why_Is_It_Diffi-47|the hope is that allies can pressure countries
Why_Is_It_Diffi-48|that protect ransomware gangs
Why_Is_It_Diffi-49|but the difficulties of stopping ransomware gangs and other cyber criminals
Why_Is_It_Diffi-50|has long been clear
Why_Is_It_Diffi-51|there are now more than 100 people on the FBI's quickly growing list
Why_Is_It_Diffi-52|Most Wanted cyber criminals
Why_Is_It_Diffi-53|any of them are not really hiding
Why_Is_It_Diffi-54|when is if Jenny bogatov

Why_Is_It_Diffi-56|he lives in a Russian Resort town
Why_Is_It_Diffi-57|the FBI says he is known to enjoy boating on the Black Sea
Why_Is_It_Diffi-58|ransomware gains can move around
Why_Is_It_Diffi-59|do not need much equipment to operate
Why_Is_It_Diffi-60|and can hide their identities
Why_Is_It_Diffi-61|they also share resources
Why_Is_It_Diffi-62|for example
Why_Is_It_Diffi-63|Darkside the group responsible for the fuel pipeline attack
Why_Is_It_Diffi-64|Lynn's is ransomware software to Partners
Why_Is_It_Diffi-65|to carry out attacks for a price
Why_Is_It_Diffi-66|the Biden Administration has not said if it plans to use offensive cyber measures against ransomware gangs
Why_Is_It_Diffi-67|press secretary Jen sake said last week
Why_Is_It_Diffi-68|that we're not going to take options off the table
Why_Is_It_Diffi-69|but she did not give further details
Why_Is_It_Diffi-70|her comments followed a ransomware attack by a Russian gang
Why_Is_It_Diffi-71|it caused outages at Brazil's JBS

Why_Is_It_Diffi-77|that he believes the US will be bringing the weight of our nation
Why_Is_It_Diffi-78|including the defense department
Why_Is_It_Diffi-79|to take down this ransomware infrastructure outside the United States

Why_Is_It_Diffi-84|during the US midterm elections in 2018
Why_Is_It_Diffi-85|after the colonial pipeline attack

Why_Is_It_Diffi-87|yet even as he was speaking from the White House in May
Why_Is_It_Diffi-88|a different Russian link ransomware group
Why_Is_It_Diffi-89|was publishing thousands of secret documents
Why_Is_It_Diffi-90|belonging to the Washington d.c. Police Department
Why_Is_It_Diffi-91|experts believe
